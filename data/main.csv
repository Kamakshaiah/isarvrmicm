Soruce,Abstract
s,"The online scenario that appeared at the beginning of the 21st century, with the creation of web 2.0 and social networks, has caused that traditional tourism promotion, needs to be planned along with marketing 2.0, with the purpose of satisfying the new touristic demands and maximizing the results of the enterprises involved in this area. Among, several social networks which are specialized in the field of tourism, TripAdvisor is defined as the biggest online journey - community in the world, which has been able to change the way of how people show their interested in a touristic product or service, on how to plan the trip or how to get information about the touristic experience of other people. TripAdvisor, displays millions of travelers' opinions in 47 countries around the world, as well as, a wide variety of options on how to plan a trip. This social network, also has more than 290 million opinions and comments over 5.3 million accommodations, restaurants and touristic destinations. Ecuador is in the ranking of countries that are part of this virtual community, considered as one of the places with the most recent touristic potential, due to, among other reasons, its environment, cuisine, cultural and social wealth, which makes it an emerging worldwide touristic destination Based on what was mentioned above, it was decided to focus this communication in the Andean country and within it, in the restaurants located in the most representative cities of Ecuador, such as, the Coast Region, Highlands, Amazon Region and Galapagos Islands, with the main purpose of knowing the travele?s profile, who makes comments of the Ecuadorian Restaurants on TripAdvisor.com, as well as the rating achieved by establishment. This study is carried out through a quantitative methodology, by the application of content analysis using a spyder to retrieve data from TripAdvisor.com. © 2017 AISTI."
s,"As the population of Facebook users is growing fast, companies are paying more attention to the influence of social networks to promote brands and are using this rising platform to carry out many marketing activities, such as operating a Facebook Page, and hosting on-line events via such pages. However, few studies have discussed the benefit, which brands could attain by operating on Facebook Pages. This study took place in Taiwan where Facebook has been very popular and aims to understand the motivation and results regarding brand experience of consumers when using social networks and the reasons affecting consumers' willingness to use companies' Facebook Pages. In doing so, we propose a model to discuss the influence from intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: brand experience and E-Word of Mouth (E-WOM). Our results show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively influence brand experience; brand love and customer effort both directly influence brand experience. Yet, brand experience influences E-WOM directly and through Facebook pages such as loyalty. We believe that our results could be useful for companies looking to exploit Facebook as a marketing tool."
s,"Product presentation in e-commerce has gained substantial attention from disciplines including information systems, marketing, psychology and management. Many studies compare newly emerging technologies and innovative presentation formats to traditional use of two-dimensional text and pictures. However, the emergent nature of these new technologies, like consumer focused virtual reality, results in instability of form and function in three-dimensional environments. This literature review synthesises the findings of extant literature, discusses important theoretical foundations and identifies the most popular research theories and research methods utilised. Additionally, it classifies constructs used to capture characteristics of presentation formats, consumers' reactions and performance, as well as marketing effects (e.g. attitudes to product and purchase intention). The literature review concludes with a discussion of implications and suggestions for future research of product presentation in e-commerce contexts. © ACIS 2017."
s,"The emergence of social media enables billions of people to share their content and in doing so they influence others and are being influenced themselves. This virtual environment provides a new perspective for the current social influence theories. In this study, the state-of-the-art literature on social influence through social media is reviewed. We find that social influence metrics, influence maximization, mobilization, Word-Of-Mouth and Online Reputation Management are important trends in this field of research. Social influence is shown to have a big impact in social media, but the best way to measure, maximize and coordinate this influence is still to be found. Building on the analyzed literature, we present the Online Social Influence Model, which shows the steps that are necessary to manage social influence through social media. The current study can be valuable to both researchers and practitioners, by providing a starting point for further research and identifying opportunities to improve marketing practices. © 2014 IADIS."
s,"Mass customization brings some flexibility and personalization based on highly variant products. However, it often fails to establish a substantial level of partnership—customer-designer collaboration. There is a need for design methodologies that tailor products around customers' specific needs and preferences while keeping the customer's voice and input in the loop throughout the preliminary design phase. This approach is vital for designing medical and healthcare products since customers' physiological and cognitive needs demand high levels of product individualization. This chapter introduces the Digital Co-Creation framework as an alternative method to alleviate challenges associated with mass customization. The framework is demonstrated via a lower-limb prosthetic casing design case study, which presents how customer-designer collaboration allows the individualization of a lower-limb prosthetic casing for two hypothetical customers with contrasting needs and preferences. The overall strategy calls for collaborative design with digital technologies and tools such as digital human modeling, enabling products tailored to customer needs and preferences, aligning with the goals and objectives discussed within the Digital Patient concept. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

s,"The extended Internet network has created a new environment for business solutions. This fact has conditioned marked changes in the marketing area associated with transformation of traditional marketing functions and strategies. In this sense, a matter of relevance is the fact that the virtual environment changes the state of customers and gives them an opportunity to become active participators in the marketing process. On the other hand, it must be noted that the effect of factors influencing consumer activity in the virtual environment can be both stimulating or restrictive. The need of marketing solutions adequate for the new environment enables us to state that recognition of factors influencing consumer behavior in the new environment is a relevant and timely question of scientific research. Factors (personal, economical, social) stimulating and restricting user activity in the virtual environment are analyzed in the article; on this basis, the methodology of empiric investigation is prepared and the investigation of factors influencing activity of students of Kaunas University of Technology in the Internet is conducted. Results of the survey enables us to identify factors that have a stimulating and restrictive effect on students' behavior in the virtual environment and to anticipate solutions necessary for their activation."
s,"Advergames are increasingly used by companies for online advertising campaigns. However, the effectiveness of this unique advertising strategy has not been investigated in the IS research literature. This study sheds light on the effectiveness of advergames by introducing three design elements of an advergame: interactivity (the extent to which a player has control over the choice of viewing the advertising message), relevancy (the extent to which the game context identifies with the advertising information), and expectancy (the extent to which the advergame form is within the expectation of the player). Two dependent variables, attitude toward advergame and attitude toward brand, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the advergame. Based on the transportation theory, we hypothesized two-way interaction effects between each pair of the three independent variables on the attitude toward the advergame, and also main effects of the dependent variables on the attitude toward a brand. A 2*2*2 factorial design experiment in a virtual world environment was used to test our hypotheses. The results indicate that in the condition of high relevancy, a more favorable attitude toward advergame was found for both high interactivity and low expectancy. Contrary to our hypothesis, in the low interactivity condition, high expectancy generates a more positive attitude toward advergame. Interestingly, interactivity was the only independent variable found to have a significant effect on the attitude toward brand."
s,"The status of online communities for clients of professional architectural services has been explored only rarely, although various communities have been established autonomously. These communities have faced challenges regarding the reliability of information and incentives for sustainable involvement of members. These concerns can be tackled by facilitating a community embracing socially embedded human actions and virtual markets in which recommendations are powerful for promoting sustainable information streams. This study aims to provide a theoretical framework to implement a structured online community in which trustworthy information are shared in sustainable manner by cultivating social actions in relationship. A preliminary investigation into the opinions of a specific group of professional architectural service clients in existing online communities is conducted. Based on relevant findings, a prototype of a structured online community, which systematizes information flows, involvement of service providers, and evaluation of service quality is developed. A main survey provides insight of clients on the motivation to upload information, usefulness of information, and expected customer power in the structured online community. © 2015, Architectural Institute of Japan.

s,"Customized avatars as imitations of individual, real customers constitute a promising concept for personalized product marketing in Internet retail. But, consolidated knowledge about effective visual design strategies of these surrogates to positively influence consumer behavior is still lacking. This work-in-progress paper presents and discusses an experimental study targeted at this gap. It focuses especially on the composition of suitable outcome measures, covering central consumer behavior-related reactions and attitudes and takes the experiential versus utilitarian characteristics of this marketing concept into account. © 2011 IADIS."
s,"The present trend of information technology makes it possible to simulate economic process courses and results very well. The simulation by itself does not replace reality but substantially improves quality. Company information systems often abound in data and information overloading. Sometimes nobody uses them and the information system does not work as a whole. For better understanding and company integration we look for more powerful tools for decision making in real time. Business flight simulators can provide company information strategy with suitable tools for decision making. Business flight simulators are able to create different ""whatif"" scenarios and analysis. Results from company information systems, data warehouses and other unstructured sources (texts, spreadsheet programs, market behavior, economic index of other companies, etc.) could be used as data. All summary indexes, on the basis of the data history, are able to create predictions and help future progress. The level of strategic planning and production control is very closely linked with other strategic areas such as marketing, trade or economy. The access to real data is one of the advantages which can be supported by simulators and can help managers make a decision and see the future impact these decisions may have. The simulator can not be isolated but it has to be integrated into the company's information system. Business flight simulators provide a kind of virtual reality. © 2010 IEEE."
s,"Virtual worlds (VWs) have emerged as a new context for gaming, collaboration, social networking but also commercial activity. This paper focuses on the latter, and investigates how consumers behave in this virtual context when selecting stores they visit or buy from. The paper explores store selection criteria in virtual world stores and extends earlier research in both offline and online commercial environments, taking into account the novel IT capabilities that VWs exploit. Theoretical insights drawn from the marketing and information systems literature have been used to guide the design of a survey conducted in the virtual world Second Life. In addition to identifying the factors influencing store selection, the paper investigates how these differ between shoppers and non-shoppers, and identifies the factors that affect the amount of money spent in virtual world shopping environments. The findings suggest that ""Core Store Features"" and ""Security and Privacy"" constitute the most important store selection factors in virtual environments and that sales in VWs are predicted by the frequency of visiting and the time spent within VWs' stores. Building on these findings, the paper discusses theoretical and practical implications and further research perspectives in the context of (3D) online commerce. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."
s,"Emerging service oriented architecture is increasing the evolution and variation of software resources. Applications that cannot adapt to dynamic environments will decrease their usefulness, particularly to business process management systems that face requirements changed frequently. In response to the realistic requirements, this paper, based on Web services and business process management techniques, propose a model of service cooperation middleware (SCM) for enterprise computing. First, it discusses the conceptual architecture and operation mechanisms of SCM, then formalizes the meta-model of cooperative processes deployed on SCM. By introducing a model transformation function into the formalization, a static process model can be extended to a dynamic one. In virtue of the reflection capability, structural reconstruction and behavioral adaptation of the dynamic processes can be achieved in SCM by introspection and effectuation. In terms of the conceptual model of SCM, a process virtual machine (PVM) is designed as a running container for cooperative processes. Borrowed from the power of MDA mechanism, the model of a business process can be transformed successively from design to run time. The business processes established on SCM can be more flexibly and extensively applied to various open environments, and leverage modern enterprise computing."
s,"This survey of literature in software economics tries to find explanations for the vulnerabilities left in commercial software products and the lack of security considerations in software and information systems (IS) that are developed from components. An examination of the information economic environment where market-driven software development occurs, which is characterized by network effects and lock-in, suggests that the schedule and the budget constraints on secure software and IS development are outcomes of rational economic behaviour. The consequences for security of first-to-market competition (e.g. shortening development-cycle, release-oriented development, beta testing) and customer lock-in (e.g. into an insecure product) are considered from an economic point of view."
s,"The article reveals an original approach to the organization of professional-oriented training and retraining of specialists in agrarian universities, which is based on the example of creating syllabuses and curriculum design in cooperation with business companies that are developers of information systems (IS). Cloud computing based IS, which were designed to automate the accounting of production and management processes in agrarian enterprises, allow students to attend training and perform a wide range of production tasks. The authors describe the main stages and results of the implementation of different ERP and CRM cloud computing systems in the training programs for bachelor and master courses in management, marketing, agronomy, as well as methods for organizing various forms of training for practicing professionals from agrarian enterprises. © IMSCI 2020.All right reserved."
s,"Gamification is defined as using game design elements, characteristic for games, in non-game contexts, and it is a process of using game mechanics to engage users and achieve a specific goal. In order to build effective gamification apps (applications) for effective user performance, the objectives of this project is to develop strategic elements for mobile gaming design in providing innovative services. The purpose of this study is mainly to use the Gamification concept to design a mobile gaming app (application) for contextual marketing, and we were integrate digital game design technologies, such as mobile augmented reality (MAR) and global positioning system (GPS). This study was then look at associated consumer value and brand loyalty created by the users after experiencing the mobile game. Accordingly, we define the eight elements of a mobile gamification design, including coping-escape, fantasy, recreation, social, omnipotence, competition, skill development, and location-based. This research model treats ""location-based"" as a formative second-order construct driven by ubiquitous connectivity and contextual offer. Consumer value is also a formative second-order construct driven by utilitarian value, hedonic value and social value. Brand loyalty is a reflective second-order construct driven by continuance intention and word-of-mouth. This study was conduct a quasi-experimental research to verify our model. It is hoped that service managers can benefit from the insights discovered from this study and implement more effective management strategies for effective performance."

s,"The present study examined flow theory in the literature and especially in ecommerce contexts: computer and online games, virtual environments, online shopping, interface design, marketing, and management. Designing for a positive user experience has become an equally important goal of interface design in addition to usability. Thus, studying user's flow experience is a valuable undertaken, which will provide insights for human computer interaction and guidance to interface design, including online and mobile applications. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted using Webster et al. (1993) instrument, which was administered to 310 subjects, following their experience navigating an apparel commercial web site. Based on the results of the factor analysis, three dimensions of flow emerged: control, attention focus, and cognitive enjoyment. Implications for contributions and future research are discussed."
s,"The increasing adoption of three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality technologies in business practices requires an interdisciplinary research approach to study their effect. In this paper we investigate the effects of different 3D online store layouts on user perceptions in the e-retailing context. We build on recent research on store atmosphere that classifies store layouts in 3D environments as “avant-garde”, “warehouse”, “pragmatic”, “boutique” and “department”. Reflecting the dual identity of individuals as both consumers visiting virtual stores and users interacting with graphical user interfaces, we employ key constructs from both the marketing and the information systems literature to build our research model. The study measures how Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Merchandise Quality Perception and Store Perception vary across the distinct store layouts. We employ a laboratory experiment in the apparel industry to test our model. Our results show that the layouts lead to different perceptions, although the consumers’ Shopping Motivation does not moderate this effect. Building on the differences found on store layout effects on user/consumer behavior in the 3D online context, the paper discusses relevant research and practical implications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

s,"LARA project is an innovative combination of different emerging technologies to develop a hand-held and mobile device that integrates state-of-the-art technologies in the domains of mobility, positioning and sensors (Global Navigation Satellite System-GNSS), Augmented Reality (AR) and 3D Geographic Information System (GIS) geo-databases. The vision of the system is to develop a system that simulates an 'X-ray camera' and is able to guide utility field workers to 'see beneath the ground' the buried infrastructures. The system renders, in high accuracy 3D models, all the complexity of the different underground grids (water, gas, sewerage, electricity, etc.) that are stored in the 3D GIS geo-database. The project has a clear intention to commercialize the products and services built therefore a detailed market analysis for the system and the definition of the appropriate business models is required. In order to prepare the commercialization strategy of the final location based and augmented reality assistive system, during the project lifetime, all consortium partners are defining and agreeing the marketing strategy and the collaborative business models that best fit system requirements and needs developed through end user workshops and technical consultations.

s,"Despite the recent popularity of Augmented Reality (AR) technology, no empirical evidence has confirmed that AR is a more effective artifact than the traditional way of product presentations on online retailers. In this study, we investigate the economic impact of AR in terms of product sales, and the volume, valence and linguistic features of product reviews. To build up credible causal evaluation, we design a natural experiment on Amazon and collect product information and consumer reviews for 423 AR-enabled products and 2,346 non-AR products from Amazon iOS app and its website, over a period of 24 weeks. We set up the data analysis with a difference-in-differences estimation. This study aims to contribute to Information System and Marketing literature and provide practical implications for online retailers looking to adopt AR technology. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved."
s,"Virtual reality (VR) technology is starting to become widely and freely available (for example the online OpenSimulator tool), with potential for use in 3D urban planning and design tasks on a correspondingly widespread scale. However, rigorous assessment on usability of such tools is needed to ascertain the likely effect on the profession. A previous study consulted with a small group of urban professionals, who concluded in a satisfaction usability test that online VR had potential value as a usable 3D communication and remote marketing tool but acknowledged that visual quality and geographic accuracy were obstacles to overcome. This research takes the investigation a significant step further to also examine the usability aspects of efficiency (how quickly tasks are completed) and effectiveness (how successfully tasks are completed), relating to OpenSimulator in an urban planning situation. The comparative study pits a three-dimensional VR model (with increased graphic fidelity and geographic content to address the feedback of the previous study) of a subdivision design (in a Dunedin suburb) against 3D models built with GIS (ArcGIS) and CAD (BricsCAD) tools, two types of software environment well established in urban professional practice. Urban professionals participated in the study by attempting to perform timed tasks correctly in each of the environments before being asked questions about the technologies involved and their perceived importance to their professional work. The results reinforce the positive feedback for VR of the previous study, with the graphical and geographic data issues being somewhat addressed (though participants stressed theneed for accurate and precise object and terrain modification capabilities in VR). Ease-of-use and associated fastest task completion speed were significant positive outcomes to emerge from the comparison with GIS and CAD, pointing to a strong future for VR in an urban planning context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."
s,"Online gaming continues to grow in popularity enabled by advances in web and mobile technology. Many players around the world enjoy the competitive atmosphere, mental challenges, social interaction and fantasy aspects of the games. However, gaming continues to be perceived as an activity for adolescents and males, which presents problems for companies trying to leverage games for training and marketing because it excludes half of the population - females. To better understand online gaming behavior of men and women we systematically reviewed extant literature on gaming and documented gender differences and similarities in six aspects of gaming: (1) Adoption, (2) Motivation, (3) Social Interaction, (4) Selfpresentation, (5) Skills and Performance, and (6) Play. We find that there are both similarities and differences in gaming choices, motives, play behavior and performance of men and women. Based on our findings, we suggest possible strategies for developers, marketers and educators to achieve gender parity."
s,"Virtual worlds such as Second Life have recently gained increased visibility from businesses seeking to market products ""in-world"" to virtual world participants. However, without understanding the sociological orientation of virtual participants, the effectiveness of marketing approaches in virtual worlds may be limited. This study utilizes a Delphi approach to determine the sociological orientation of a panel of Second Life participants, with the goal of constructing a theoretical model which can be used for testing the effectiveness of various marketing approaches in virtual worlds."

s,"A solution to cope with chaotic urban settlements and frenetic everyday life is refuging in nature as a way to reduce stress. In general—in recent years—it has been scientifically demonstrated how natural areas are an important environment for psycho-physiological health. As a consequence, it is important to plan dedicated spaces for stress recovery in order to increase the well-being of people. With respect to forests, there is a growing interest in understanding the marketing and tourist potential of forest-therapy activities and policies. This paper develops a decision support system (DSS) for decision makers, based on geographic information system to define the suitability of forest areas to improve psychological and physiological human well-being. Innovative technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) and virtual reality (VR) are applied to test human status. The DSS combines four sets of indicators in a multi-attribute decision analysis and identifies the areas with the largest stress-recovery potential. Two multi-attribute model—one in summer and one in winter—are elaborated to obtain a dynamic evaluation of suitability. Results show significant differences among forest type, forest management, altitude range, and season in terms of stand suitability. EEG and VR seem to be promising technologies in this research area. Strengths and weaknesses of the approach, as well as potential future improvement and implications for territorial marketing, are suggested. © 2021, The Author(s)."

This system is intended to be integrated with the virtual GIS technology enabling the consumer to virtually explore the potential property based upon the multi criteria selection through assisted geo-processing query. The proposed system is built using Adobe Flex on ArcGIS Server framework to enable geo-processing and geometric network capabilities. Through the pilot system, the success of 3D and virtual reality integration was revealed. Due to limitations of the query functions and 3D feature complexity taking its toll on the system’s performance, an improved geoprocessing scheme is presented in this paper and the conceptual design of this system is revised. The improved query function which includes road network and accessibility were taken into consideration in solving buffer and radius query is developed. The revised conceptual design will further be used in designing the simplified 3D visualization viewer to the Virtual panoramic display. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."
s,"Augmented Reality and Gamification are displaying beneficial effects to enhance user experience and performance in many domains. They are widespread across many areas like education, industrial training, marketing, and services. However, the idea of combining the two approaches for an innovative training instrument is fairly new, especially in assembly training. Moreover, learning about the effects of gamification on human, user engagement, in particular, is a complicated subject. There have been several efforts toward this direction, yet the overall situation is still nascent. In this work, we present a gamified augmented reality training for an industrial task and investigate user engagement effect while training with the gamified and the nongamified system. The result shows that people perform better and engage to a greater degree in the gamified design. © 2019 Polish Information Processing Society - as since."
s,"Retail trading on financial exchanges is always intermediated by banks. Thus, a direct link between exchange and retail investors does not exist. However, financial exchanges offer services to retail investors. Thus, from a marketing perspective, retail investors are their direct customers. Caused by the bank-intermediated transaction chain on financial retail exchanges a direct customer relationship management (CRM) among exchanges and their customers is hardly possible. This circumvents a customer oriented product and pricing policy. Thus banks, as they are nowadays the direct link between exchanges and retail investors, define the market micro structures of the financial exchanges to a large extend. This is true not only for the bank driven whole sale trading but as well for the retail trading. Ongoing developments of new exchange facilities for the retail trading, such as best execution functionalities, downsizing of the odd lots, adoption of trading hours, the emergence of electronic off exchange trading systems etc. show, that there is a need for improved retail trading platforms. To overcome these CRM related problems in the financial exchange industry a joined project between the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Potsdam University was set up to implement a platform for a direct CRM among retail investors and financial exchanges. This project relies on web 2.0 technologies to build up a virtual community where the exchange and retail investors can share information about needs, requirements, and ideas about the market model for a retail trading platform and other relevant trading and settlement facilities. The aim of this contribution is to describe this platform and their advantages for retail investors and for stock exchanges and to provide an outlook of the applicability of web 2.0 technologies in the financial exchange industry. An overview of the implementation and initialization phase of the community will be provided and first results and responses of community members are analysed."

s,"This study has two major concentrations: 1) exploring methods of creating a digital city model, and 2) applying the model to study urban spatial structure, an issue of particular interest and importance to urban planners. Based on existing studies that primarily address two-dimensional (2D) urban structure, this paper focuses on the threedimensional (3D) structure relating to the 3D urban form. Given their greater clarity and possibilities for quantitative analysis, both 3D digital urban models and GIS spatial overlay analysis methods hold tremendous potential for analysing and predicting future urban form. In this project, the Xidan Business District in Beijing's Inner City was the area selected to implement the digital-city application. Under the hypothesis that the existing urban spatial structure is determined by the city's urban planning scheme and current urban marketing forces, it is found that actual urban development does not follow the planning restrictions on zoning and building height regulations. Some contradictions and conflicts, such as building location and height, appeared in the studied district. The specific reasons for the discrepancies need to be further studied. © 2005 Springer."
s,"With the growth of the video game industry, interest in video game research has increased, leading to the study of Serious Games. Serious Games are generally perceived as games with purposes other than mere entertainment. These purposes range from education to training, marketing to design, among others. By exploiting the potential of these virtual worlds, we can provide the possibility to experience situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience in the real world, mainly due to reasons of cost, safety and time. Web browsers can now provide easy access to realistic virtual worlds with WebGL, which grants video game developers the tools to create compelling and rich environments that can be used in the future by virtually anyone.

s,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism) on the adoption of augmented reality (AR), with a particular focus on the role AR may play in interactive marketing. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative-based approach was followed by a questionnaire survey, which was completed by 230 respondents comprising graduate and postgraduate students, using structural equation modelling. Findings: While the trait of openness was positively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms, the trait of neuroticism was negatively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR. Extraversion was positively associated with subjective norms. Perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms were positively associated with attitudes toward AR. Practical implications: The data gathered will add a valuable contribution to the currently limited data available on empirical consumer behaviour research, particularly in relation to the adoption of AR for interactive marketing. Originality/value: The findings of this study will benefit academics working on the adoption of technology in rapidly developing fields such as automation and artificial intelligence; the study also contributes to the emerging interdisciplinary domain of psychology, information systems, marketing and human behaviour. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

s,"Via the recent proliferation of consumer-grade head-mounted VR technologies, the retailers as well as related scholarly areas have started to increasingly notice the possible potential of virtual reality. However, there is no coherent understanding of the state-of-the-art of the literature on VR shopping, how VR shopping has been investigated and what empirically indicated benefits VR has for a variety of marketing outcomes. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically review the published body of literature on VR shopping (N = 40). The current study contributes to the VR shopping and marketing literature by mapping the VR technologies, product types, consumer experiences and research methods in the extant literature. The review shows that the literature on VR shopping is still in its infancy and there remains ample room for progression both in breadth and depth in the literature on VR shopping in terms of methodological rigor and theoretical prowess. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

s,"People involved in business are increasingly aware of the online social phenomenon and its potential as a marketing tool. Building upon the marketing, social psychology, and information system literature, this study empirically examines a set of functional determinants derived from the technology acceptance model and socio-psychological determinants drawn from the theory of reasoned action and social cognitive theory that may be responsible for the motivations of participants in online social networks. We propose a model by integrating functional, social, and psychological factors in predicting attitude and online social network usage. The survey outcomes from a cross-sectional study among 387 Facebook users in Malaysia support the hypothesised model. This study contributes by extending the cognitive learning theories in predicting online social networking usage. Particularly, this research presents a different perspective on online social networking by exploring the mediating effect of attitude and the moderating role of individual characteristics. This study demonstrates that desirable changes in the perception of functional benefits, self-efficacy, and need for cognition as well as perceptions of social pressure from significant others might lead to corresponding changes in attitude towards online social networking. Results of the study support the model efficacy and predictive ability of the proposed integrative model which may serve as a theoretical foundation for future researchers interested in examining other virtual community engagements such as blogging, online advertising, and online public relations activities. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."
s,"This paper studies three digital media development models in virtual world. We characterize the revenue mechanisms behind each model, by incorporating the concept of horizontal and vertical supply chain integration of digital media industry. We incorporate the core value of digital media development in the first model, which considers digital media as information goods. Pricing, quality differentiation, quantity discrimination, and content design combined determine the VW popularity and the financial performance. Based on the first model, the second model incorporates the advertising revenue. It becomes essential to optimize both information goods revenue and advertising revenue, while increasing one would decrease the other due to the traffic dynamics. Based on the first two models, the third model considers both vertical and horizontal supply chain integration in the digital media industry. In this model, we add one extra dimension of network externality that leads to better understanding of consumers, suppliers, and their mutual interest. Based on these three models, we suggest several strategic implications that facilitate operations, increase revenue, and enhance consumer experience, including strategic alliance, reduction of virtual-real world barriers, and tailored advertisement."

The metaverse is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the world of sports. In this research work, we used the Scopus database to extract documents published in the domain of sports and metaverse. The descriptive analysis and collaboration analysis of existing literature, and topic modeling Latent Dirichlet Allocation of abstracts highlight the use of augmented reality, virtual reality, blockchain, artificial intelligence, wearables, and the Internet of Things in building domain-specific applications. The findings reveal that these technologies can enhance the learning and training experience for athletes, providing them with immersive and interactive environments to hone their skills. The physical and psychological well-being of athletes can be ensured with the rational use of metaverse. However, the use of these technologies also raises concerns about privacy and the protection of data. The research in the domain of information technology and information systems from marketing is also unexplored. As the metaverse continues to evolve, it is important for the sports industry to address these concerns and ensure that the use of these technologies is done in a responsible and ethical manner. © 2024, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing."

s,"This research focuses on perceptions and reactions to the intangible nature of newly digitized transaction processing systems. For many consumers, the intangibility of information system-based processes generates beliefs that they are fake, non-genuine, artificial and therefore inherently risky to use. This perceived artificiality phenomenon was shown to increase risk concerns, which in-turn inhibited system adoption. Investigating reactions to an e-service replacement of a paper process enabled testing of this proposed conceptual causal chain. Results suggest that the inherent intangibility of e-services creates concerns measured in raised perceived artificiality and perceived risk. Interestingly, mental rather than physical intangibility increased artificiality concerns. Perceived artificiality directly increased risk concerns and indirectly affected system evaluation and adoption, which were primarily affected by system perceived risk. This exploratory research suggests a research model that provides a first step towards understanding the effect of information systems' inherent intangibility on system evaluation and adoption, and may be utilized when testing risk-reducing system enhancements."
s,"People have been sharing information since ancient times. The method of transmission and communication changes concerning the environment and the needs of man. Therefore, marketing has become one of the main representatives and tools of communication in advertising. The development of technology is moving forward in various areas, so marketing communication is not lagging. Day by day, it increases the interconnection between people, companies and institutions through modern information tools. The time when marketing focused primarily on the sale of products and services has to some extent disappeared. The old way of promoting goods has become unattractive to society. Today, on the contrary, communication is advancing, the main interest of which is the feelings and emotions of consumers, and therefore it does not put profit first, but people's satisfaction. The presented article aims to increase the interest of the final consumer in the selected institution by applying a modern marketing strategy—event marketing. Within the application of event marketing, the tools Industry 4.0 were used, which use modern information systems to create a closer connection between the company and customers. For this particular application of Industry 4.0 tools and the implementation of event marketing, we chose a tour of the selected institution using a virtual tour, which should arouse customers' interest in a real visit to the institution and its services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
s,"Over the past several years, brands have entered the world of video games as part of their branded content strategy. There are two types of video game advertising: advergaming and in-game advertising. The aim of the study was to analyze how is the presence of different brands in the game NBA2K18, along with its different formats. NBA2K18 is a series of basketball video games developed by Sega Dreamcast. This study is positioned in the interpretative paradigm with a qualitative methodology. For data collection, the technique used was the participatory observation. As a result, it was evidence that the different participating brands in NBA2K18 have mimicked with the game storytelling in the players' self-realization process. They have applied both dynamic and static in-game advertising formats throughout the game. Brands have managed to be part of the narrative; this result would have been completely different if they had created a game from scratch as proposed by the advergaming model. © 2021 AISTI."
s,"BioStories is the outcome of a three and a half years research project focused in uniting affective and ubiquitous computing with context aware multimedia content generation and distribution. Its initial premise was based in the possibility of performing real-time automatic emotion assessment trough online biometric channels monitoring and use this information to design on-the-fly dynamic multimedia storylines emotionally adapted, so that end users would unconsciously be choosing the story flow. The emotion assessment process was based on dynamic fusion of biometric channels such as EEG, GSR, respiration rate and volume, skin temperature and heart rate on top of Russell's circumplex model of affect. BioStories' broad scope also allowed for some spin-off projects namely mouse control through EMG that resulted in a patented technology for alternative/inclusive interfaces. Exhaustive experiments showed 87% of success rate for emotion assessment in a dynamic tridimensional virtual environment with an immersiveness score of 4.2 out of 5. The success of the proposed approach allows the vision of its appliance in several domains such as virtual entertainment, videogames and cinema as well as direct marketing, digital TV and domotic appliances."
s,"Ecological degradation is an escalating global threat. Increasingly, people are expressing awareness and priority for concerns about environmental problems surrounding them. Environmental protection issues are highlighted. An appropriate information technology tool, the growing popular social network system (virtual community, VC), facilitates public education and engagement with applications for existent problems effectively. Particularly, the exploration of related involvement behavior of VC member engagement is an interesting topic. Nevertheless, member engagement processes comprise interrelated sub-processes that reflect an interactive experience within VCs as well as the value co-creation model. To address the top-focused ecotourism VCs, this study presents an application of a hybrid expert-based ISM model and DEMATEL model based on multi-criteria decision making tools to investigate the complex multidimensional and dynamic nature of member engagement. Our research findings provide insightful managerial implications and suggest that the viral marketing of ecotourism protection is concerned with practitioners and academicians alike. © 2013 Huan-Ming Chuang et al."

Its initial premise was based in the possibility of performing real-time automatic emotion assessment trough online biometric channels monitoring and use this information to design on-the-fly dynamic multimedia storylines emotionally adapted, so that end users would unconsciously be determining the story graph. The emotion assessment process was based on biometric channels dynamic fusion such as EEG, GSR, respiration rate and volume, skin temperature and heart rate on top of Russell's circumplex model of affect. BioStories' broad scope also allowed for some spin-off projects namely mouse control through EMG that resulted in a tested technology for alternative/inclusive interfaces. Exhaustive experiments showed 86% of success rate for emotion assessment, IC95%(p)?(0.81, 0.90), in a dynamic tridimensional virtual environment with an immersiveness user score of 4.3 out of 5. The success of the proposed approach allows the vision of its appliance in several domains such as virtual entertainment, videogames and cinema as well as direct marketing, digital TV and domotic appliances. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
s,"Virtual communities not only allow customers to share ideas and help each other, but also provide new venues for vendors to manage customer relationships. Two studies are presented showing how two companies, one in the software industry and one in the airline industry, have successfully enhanced their relationship with customers by strategically participating in virtual communities. Both companies have gained benefits in the forms of customer loyalty, increased customer satisfaction, and less support calls. Our research suggests that companies designate employees to spend a few hours each week to monitor relevant virtual communities. This enables the company to develop an intimate yet informal relationship with customers. Lessons learned from this type of informal support are: the vendor employees need to clearly identify their positions, the support should be unofficial, and the community should not be used as another marketing channel."
s,"In this paper, we present a tele-meeting system which uses an augmented robot agent as the representation of the remote participant. In this system, we augment a 3D volume video of the remote participant over the on-site robot. The robot agent in this system represents a remote user with camera, microphone, and mobility. Using this robot agent, the remote user and the local user can show their appearances and interact with tangible interfaces. This robot agent system can be applied to various tele-meeting applications such as tele-marketing and tele-tutoring. For example, we implemented a tele-marketing system to show the feasibility of the suggested system. © 2008 IEEE."
s,"This study aimed to investigate and provide insight into the drivers and motivations behind users' intentions for using car dashcams. The study utilized a purposive sampling technique with a sample size of 225 and obtained responses through a structured questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to verify the proposed hypotheses. The findings demonstrated that the perceived quality of the system, the quality of the information, and the quality of the interaction positively influenced the perceived ease of use and usefulness of using car dashcams. Attitude and behavioral intention were affected by perceived ease of use and usefulness, while perceived usefulness had no influence on intention to use car dashcams. While hedonic motivation and price value impacted behavioral intention, social intention did not affect it. Attitude was found to fully mediate the path between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. The outcomes of the study incorporate a considerable amount of knowledge into the adoption behavior of telematics literature by integrating prevalent technology adoption models into a unified model: The information system success model (ISS), technology acceptance model (TAM), and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2). The findings provide valuable insights for marketers, the dash cam industry, and policymakers to enhance their understanding of the critical factors affecting the adoption of car dashcams, which can assist in customizing their marketing campaigns and policies to encourage the usage of dashcams, leading to improved road safety and safe driving behavior.  © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company."
s,"As can be seen from the fact that the tourism information system, which was produced in paper-based format, is evolving to be based on the Internet, the tourism information platform has been continuously developed with the proliferation of information technology (IT). Social media, which has been rapidly increasing, has become a popular tool for ubiquitously collecting and sharing tourism information based on a mobile digital environment. The evolution of the travel IT system brings a question like, “What will be the next tourism information platform?"" Metaverse has attracted enormous attention because of the combination of the non-face-to-face lifestyles resulting from the prolonged pandemic and convergent digital technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As the VR, AR, and virtual influencers have been prolific rapidly, it is expected that the Metaverse is vital for marketing toward tourists. This chapter discusses the definition of the Metaverse, some exemplary applications, and its four categories: AR, lifelogging, mirror worlds, and virtual worlds. This chapter provides meaningful insights into tourism marketing by understanding that the Metaverse can be used as a new travel IT platform and promotion channel in the digital environment. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Alastair M.

s,"The concepts of value creation and co-creation have been widely discussed, yet the contribution that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can make in this area is under-researched. The objective of this study is to investigate the nature of value creation and co-creation practices in C2C social commerce highlighting the role of ICT in the practices. This research in progress paper outlines the development of a framework which will be used to investigate the relationship between ICT and value creation in the C2C social commerce environment. The framework concentrates on four key elements in the co-creation of value: the role of ICT; relationships; actors; and types of value. The framework has been developed based on an extensive literature review of relevant research in the areas of Marketing and Information Systems. The intention is to test the framework on C2C social commerce sites in South East Asia. © Syahida Hassan and Janet Toland 2013."
s,"Recent attempts to apply virtual reality to e-commerce implies the need for a better understanding of this emerging immersive presentation medium as an approach for digitisation and marketing of product and brand. Compared with two-dimensional presentation media (e.g. text and images), virtual reality is much more capable of enabling ""presence"", the perceptual illusion of nonmediation or the feeling of being in the virtual environment instead of in the real world. This explorative study will investigate what characteristics of immersive virtual reality artefacts and their associated virtual space to digitally stimulate ""presence"", and whether and how ""presence"" can affect consumers' online shopping behaviour. By adopting a phenomenological approach, the findings will help to sensemake relationships of presence in online shopping context among concrete virtual environment design options, presence, and other relevant constructs, through the analysis of data collected from semi-structured interviews of users of a virtual reality shopping app. © ACIS 2017."
s,"The term “smart city” has recently become greatly widespread in academic and political discourse. Nevertheless, this is rather a marketing term that unites a number of technological (and other) areas: Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), communication networks. The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research. The results of the study can be used in further theoretical and applied research, in the formation of government policy in research and development, as well as in decision-making in the field of urban management. © 2019, Geographical Institute ""Jovan Cviji"" of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

s,"The strategies adopted by the automotive industry for order fulfillment are discussed. Vehicle manufacturers (VM) need ways to shorten the cycle from order taking to delivery of vehicle to the customers. The Internet and integrated information systems have helped the VMs in maintaining the production schedule. When a customization service is offered, the customer can select, combine and configure attributes of a vehicle rather than accept a selection from a pre-configured set of variants. The objective for managing the pipeline in a virtual-build-to-order (VBTO) system is to satisfy customers by matching their specification and lead-time expectations."
s,"Virtual worlds are three-dimensional, computer-generated worlds in which users take the form of avatars and use those avatars to interact with objects and other avatars in the virtual world. Virtual worlds are growing in importance in both educational institutions and businesses. Educational institutions have adopted virtual worlds as a medium for instructional delivery whereas businesses are using virtual worlds for recruitment, training, collaboration, and marketing. Given these emerging phenomena, a better understanding of behavioral and perceptual issues in virtual worlds is warranted. We propose a research model to study the interaction effects of gender stereotypicality of male and female avatars and gender typicality of tasks on trust perceptions. Gender stereotypes have been widely studied in the real world along with their effects on trust perceptions. An experiment is proposed to examine the effects of gender stereotypes on trust perceptions in virtual worlds. Implications and expected contributions are also discussed. © (2009) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved."
s,"Variable economic conditions, new forms of customer buying behavior and in particular new technology is likely to cause the emergence of new or growing existing hospitality markets. In developed European economies, all the more attention is paid to studying the role of new technologies in the field of hospitality marketing. Research focus will be directed towards the usage of technological systems in marketing of hospitality. Internet, as one of the most significant technological phenomena of our time, provides hotel managers completely new competitive opportunities, of which the most significant opportunity to provide immediate and always open access to information throughout the world. According to latest researches, Croatian hotel managers usually use these technological systems: Own web site, System to access the Internet, Points of sale (POS), System of calculating the telephone calls, Local area network (LAN), Uniform system of accounts for lodging Industry (USALI), Intranet system, Central reservation system (CRS), Marketing information system (MIS) and. Object management system (PMS). Modern hotel managers want to achieve automation of marketing strategies and interactive communication with potential guests. However, certain hotels are still not developed a marketing strategy through the Internet pages. Adjustment trends must be timely and possible, so it is necessary to intensify investment in that direction. As a result, it is assumed that the possibility of information and purchase via the Internet to stimulate the future purchase of tourists and change their previous spending habits. To make hotel companies improve their e-marketing strategy, the research shows insufficient usage of the following Web 2.0 tools in Croatian hospitality market: Instant Messaging, Internet Relay Chat, Internet Forums, Social Network Services, Social Guides, Social Bookmarking, Social Reputation Network, Web logs, Social Citations, Peer-to-peer Social Networks, Virtual Presence, Virtual Worlds Massively Multiplayer Online Games, VOIP - Internet Telephony and Mobile Internet.

s,"This study examines the essential characteristics of Virtual Reality (VR) that influence individual visit intention towards a touristic product. Despite the extensive research about VR, however, only little has examined the impact of factors that alter customers' attitudes and trigger purchasing intention. This study applied Information Systems Success Model and conducted a survey using the convenience sampling method with international tourists who visited North Cyprus. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, and findings demonstrated that VR has great potential to influence visitors' final destination by promoting tourism products and services. This paper revealed that VR-as a marketing medium-creates positive impacts and stimulates individuals' intentions to visit a destination. The study provides implications for tourism sector actors such as tourism planners, policymakers, travel agencies, and hotel managers as well as prosocial guest experience to improve their marketing strategies. © 2020 by the authors."
s,"This research uses the theory of flow to examine the effect of 2D versus 3D virtual world environments on brand equity and use intention. The results suggest that a 3D virtual world environment has both positive (indirect) and negative (direct) effects on brand equity. The positive, indirect effect of the 3D virtual world environment occurs through feelings of telepresence and enjoyment, both of which contribute positively to brand equity and, in turn, induces a higher behavioral intention. The negative, direct effect can be explained using distraction-conflict theory, where attentional conflict is faced by users of a highly interactive and rich medium. This paper explains the flow experience and its effects on brand equity in 2D versus 3D virtual world environments, and provides insights to practitioners for designing 3D virtual world sites to enhance brand equity and behavioral intention."

s,"The objective of the study is to explore the effect of scaffolding strategy in enhancing students' application ability in a 3D virtual learning environment. In order to provide students with a ""hands-on"" experience, we utilized virtual reality technology to build a 3D virtual supermarket (3DVS) to guide students to apply class theory to the practice. There is a female virtual customer poses questions during her shopping in the 3DVS, the participants have to be a clerk to answer the questions. The questions posed by the virtual customer are designed based on marketing mix theory (Kotler et al., 2006). We invited ten students to understand the system efficiency. The results of the interview indicated that the participants hold quite positive comments toward the system."
s,"With the proliferation of Web 2.0 technologies, there is an expanded opportunity for individuals to get involved in information exchange. In this study, the sustainability of a virtual community for teachers and educators were investigated. The research model borrows the key concepts from the IS continuance model, social influence theory, the uses and gratifications paradigm, and relationship marketing to explain user intention to continue using a virtual community, as well as intention to recommend the community to others. Satisfaction, commitment, group norms are found to have significant impacts on intention to continue using and intention to recommend. Among the three factors, satisfaction has the highest impact on behavioral intentions. Individual-related factors (purposive value and self-discovery) are found to have significant impacts on user satisfaction, while social-related factors are more important in determining commitment and group norms. The results of this study provide important implications for both research and practice."

s,"Social virtual world users are spending millions of real money on virtual products and services, but are they willing to spend money on real products in-world? This study investigates the willingness of active Second Life users to shop for real products in-world and explores the benefits and drawbacks which may play a determining role in the adoption of this alternative retail channel. While many SVW users appear to be willing to purchase real products from the metaverse channel, other users raise some important security, safety and privacy concerns that need to be addressed. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that most SVW users perceive metaverse retailing as an extension to the traditional online channel, but with more fun and better product inspection capabilities. They seem to accept buying search as well as experience products from the in-world channel."
s,"The use of virtual prototyping early in the design stage of a product has gained popularity due to reduced cost and time to market. The state of the art in vehicle simulation has reached a level where full vehicles are analyzed through simulation but major difficulties continue to be present in interfacing the vehicle model with accurate powertrain models and in developing adequate formulations for the contact between tire and terrain (specifically, scenarios such as tire sliding on ice and rolling on sand or other very deformable surfaces). The proposed work focuses on developing a ground vehicle simulation capability by combining several third party packages for vehicle simulation, tire simulation, and powertrain simulation. The long-term goal of this project is to promote the Digital Car idea through the development of a reliable and robust simulation capability that will enhance the understanding and control of off-road vehicle performance. To this end we concentrate our attention on two main aspects: (1) development of a family of tire and contact models suitable for simulations ranging from high accuracy to real time for on/off-road conditions and extreme environments, and (2) investigation of co-simulation techniques suitable from a numerical standpoint to support long simulations of heterogeneous models that contain vehicle, tire, terrain, powertrain, and controls subsystems.

s,"Information systems are transforming health care delivery. A conceptual framework is proposed for identifying issues relating to use of information systems and evaluation of outcomes that can be applied universally. Technology use with children and families with chronic illness can be affected by barriers such as poor education or marketing of technology, health care providers' time constraints, perceived benefits of using technology, and the experiences providers and patients have with technology. Measurable outcomes include patient and provider satisfaction, preferred types of technology, cost-benefit ratio, educational and support benefits to patients, and perceptions of technology.

s,"Marketing professionals gradually utilize virtual communities as a new media for affecting sales by spreading information about brand, quality, price, experience, effectiveness, etc. Studies related to this subject usually focus on influence of electronic word of mouth and posters' opinions on product choice. Lack of considering passive participants and natures of virtual community induces our interest. For comprehensively understanding every participant's attitude toward information in virtual communities, we classified members based on their activities of posting, viewing and accepting information. According to the classification, we further explore comparative importance of antecedents regarding to members' intention to adopt information for purchasing decision-making in variant groups. Data was collected by questionnaires and actual number of posting behaviors. Results show that the importance of economic, relational and social factors varies from different groups. Information shoppers, who browse most information and rarely post messages, view relational and social factors as main contributors toward intention to adopting information as a decision aid. Advice seekers, who expect to get effective recommendations and rarely post messages, think relational factors is a major determinant. Advice providers, who are primary posters and seldom accepting others' opinions, think economic and social factors are important to intention of adopting information."
s,"Online shopping often requires consumers to choose among multiple products without detailed information about the quality. Herding is common in situations where consumers infer product quality from other consumers' choices and incorporate that information into their own decision-making process. The Internet affects the herding phenomenon in two ways. On the one hand, it provides more information about other consumers' choices, therefore making herding more feasible. On the other hand, it provides more details about product quality, thus making herding less desirable. This paper empirically examines those two effects in the context of online software downloading. We find significant herd behavior in our analysis, and, surprisingly, the provision of professional product reviews or user reviews does not significantly influence the herding phenomenon. This study contributes to the E-Commerce and the Internet marketing research by investigating online consumer behavior. This paper also contributes to the emerging literature of studying the impact of virtual communities."

s,"Virtual communities are an increasingly popular way to conduct business over the Internet. However, from the service provider's point of view they pose special challenges. In particular, unless the provider itself engages in content or service provision, the service relies entirely on its members for provision of services. The members should thus be seen as resources for service provision. This type of networked service production system implies challenges in terms of service quality management and, subsequently, value creation for community members. This paper explores these issues by revisiting service marketing and service operations literature on service quality. Our analysis of the literature indicates that firms facilitating virtual communities need to ensure the quality of their service by not only ensuring technical quality but also by nurturing the social aspects of the community that have an impact on the willingness of community members to provide service to each other."
s,"A growing number of companies use mobility data in their day-to-day business. However, as the data grows older, new data has to be collected in order to keep applications up-to-date. Consequently, it is of great importance to know the impact that a different mobility sample may cause. This aspect of analysis has been largely neglected in mobility data mining research so far. In this paper we therefore analyze the robustness of performance measures with respect to a changed GPS sample in outdoor advertisement. The evaluation of outdoor advertising campaigns is a challenging application because it requires the evaluation of mobility data on a very fine spatial level. Thus, the application has a higher dependency on routes of individual test persons than classical mobility surveys. In our robustness analysis we apply bootstrapping and subsampling in order to measure the effect of a) a repeated mobility survey and b) a mobility survey of smaller size. We conduct our experiments on a real-world data set from Swiss outdoor advertising. Our results show that the effect is comparably small for a typical campaign and may be mitigated further by increasing the campaign size. © 2011 IEEE."

s,"Augmented reality retail applications (ARRAs) have emerged as rapidly developing innovative and futuristic retail innovation used in both physical store and online shops to improve the retail settings and customer experience. So, the objective of this research was to identify predictors of user benefits of ARRA in the retail food chain. By integrating the theory of information system success model, this study proposes a model to investigate the mediating effect of two values: (1) user satisfaction and (2) user continuance intention between quality perspective as explanatory variables (system, service, and information quality) and user benefits as the outcome variable. Both the mediating factors are found positively playing mediating roles among all proposed relationships.

s,"To meet changing business and market requirements many businesses opt for digital transformation, a process entailing the integration of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Information systems, Big Data, etc. into all their business practices. Covid-19 pandemic urged companies worldwide to engage in digital transformation for reasons of survival, competitiveness, and adaption to the emerged conditions. The present study investigates the engagement of small Greek companies into digital transformation process during the Covid-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was used as a research tool and was distributed throughout Greece. The collected data showed that digital transformation is still in its early stages in Greece, although Greek entrepreneurs consider it a key element to make their businesses viable. A future study, with a bigger sample and more research tools, when Covid-19 pandemic ends, might contribute to a better understanding of digital transformation process in Greece under circumstances different than those of a pandemic crisis.  © 2021 IEEE."
s,"In the digital era, virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized the museum experience, redefining how visitors engage with cultural artifacts and exhibits. This research investigates the profound impact of VR on museums, specifically focusing on its influence on visitor satisfaction, loyalty, and the democratization of cultural heritage. By combining the information systems (IS) success model, flow theory, and the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) model, this study offers a comprehensive framework to analyze the complex dynamics of VR integration within museums. The findings reveal that visitor satisfaction and loyalty are closely linked to the quality of information, system functionality, and aesthetic appeal in VR-enhanced museum spaces. Flow experience serves as a mediating factor, elucidating the psychological underpinnings of visitor engagement and the attainment of positive outcomes. By evaluating dimensions such as information quality (IQ), system quality (SQ), aesthetic quality (AQ), flow experience (FE), visitor satisfaction (VS), and visitor loyalty (VL), this research provides practical recommendations for museums seeking to thrive in the digital age. Also, the study explores the global accessibility facilitated by VR, making cultural collections accessible to diverse audiences and expanding the influence of museums worldwide. The research emphasizes the importance of information systems management and marketing strategies in maximizing the benefits of VR-enhanced museum experiences, ultimately leading to greater visitor satisfaction. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of VR’s impact on museums and calls for strategic interventions to ensure the continued relevance and growth of museums in the digital era. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Herding is common in such situations which require consumers to infer product quality from other consumers' choices and incorporate that information into their own decision-making process. The Internet affects the herding phenomenon in two ways. On the one hand, it provides more information about other consumers' choices, making herding more feasible. On the other hand, the Internet provides more details about product quality, thus making herding less desirable. In this paper, we empirically examine those two effects in the context of online software downloading. We collected data on daily software downloads and studied how the daily download market share is related to the cumulative number of downloads and to the professionals' and users' ratings. We find significant herd behavior in our analysis of customers' software choices. Surprisingly, the provision of professional product reviews or user reviews does not have a significant influence on the herding phenomenon. Our results suggest that consumers are in favor of information inferred from others' behavior, but choose to ignore other sources of information. Such results are consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature. Our results also indicate that the vast amount of information provided on the Internet may not have as great an impact on consumer decision-making as previously expected. This paper contributes to e-commerce and Internet marketing research by investigating and offering a more in-depth understanding of online consumer behavior. This paper also contributes to the emerging literature on the impact of virtual communities."
s,"Virtual reality (VR) technology is starting to become widely and freely available (for example the online OpenSimulator tool), with potential for use in 3D urban planning and design tasks but still needing rigorous assessment to establish this. A previous study consulted with a small group of urban professionals, who concluded in a satisfaction usability test that online VR had potential value as a usable 3D communication and remote marketing tool but acknowledged that visual quality and geographic accuracy were obstacles to overcome. This research takes the investigation a significant step further to also examine the usability aspects of efficiency (how quickly tasks are completed) and effectiveness (how successfully tasks are completed), relating to OpenSimulator in an urban planning situation. The comparative study pits a three-dimensional VR model (with increased graphic fidelity and geographic content to address the feedback of the previous study) of a subdivision design (in a Dunedin suburb) against 3D models built with GIS (ArcGIS) and CAD (BricsCAD) tools, two types of software environment well established in urban professional practice. Urban professionals participated in the study by attempting to perform timed tasks correctly in each of the environments before being asked questions about the technologies involved and their perceived importance to their professional work. The results reinforce the positive feedback for VR of the previous study, with the graphical and geographic data issues being somewhat addressed (though participants stressed the need for accurate and precise object and terrain modification capabilities in VR). Ease-ofuse and associated fastest task completion speed were significant positive outcomes to emerge from the comparison with GIS and CAD, pointing to a strong future for VR in an urban planning context."

s,"It has been shown that virtual reality (VR) can be utilized for sales and marketing since it can enable the users to virtually and realistically experience the products they want to purchase. Further, there have some efforts to extend such VR systems by adding product configuration, analysis, and manufacturing/production information services. The limitations of these previous efforts were that they used expensive and proprietary VR tools, and they did not address the issue of integrating distributed and heterogeneous data sources. This paper proposes an information system architecture to overcome these limitations. The architecture is composed of a product configuration module (PCM) based on Java and Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), and a product analysis module (PAM) based on Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). The PCM enables the users to virtually experience products from their own Web browsers on any computer platforms anywhere anytime. The PAM performs product analysis and provides decision-making information from distributed and heterogeneous data sources, for example, part information from vendors around the world. That is, the users can configure and virtually experience the products that they want to purchase on any client workstations such as PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix workstations. Further, they will be provided with the product analysis and manufacturing/production information from various data sources including relational databases such as Oracle, Sybase, etc. A prototype system has been implemented to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The results of this paper can be used to greatly expand Web-based global marketing services, especially for virtual enterprises."

s,"This paper presents a distributed information system that facilitates virtual multidisciplinary product development activities. A growing problem today for many companies is that of facing up to increasing global competition, increasing the importance of delivering the right product at the right time and at the least cost. To enable a company to provide competitive services, concurrent engineering methods are employed progressively more often. However, a truly effective concurrent engineering team requires specialists in a wide variety of occupations and skill bases. Effective communication and exchange of information between members usually require not only face-to-face meetings but also highly advanced tools. Various tools have been developed in the past with the premise of facilitating effective communication. However, these have realistically only covered a subsection of the total product development life-cycle. The work presented here displays an approach to the problem in terms of an Internet-based system, which provides a mechanism to allow integrated information sharing from the initial concepts through to the realization and the marketing of a product. The system effectively removes the barriers between people and incompatible computer systems and resulting from non-standardization."
s,"This paper studies a new paradigm for building and using Business Information Systems, accompanied by the required enabling technologies and business models, which will assimilate innovative marketplace concepts and thus allow for better process/activity oriented management. The proposed approach is inter-disciplinary (technology and management) and relies on combining the mobile object (agent) technology with the ABC/ABM model (Activity Based Costing/Management) towards what could be called 'real time management'. The core idea concerns the deployment of Active Business Objects, which may form an essential part of the emerging Global Business Infrastructure. In the ABO approach we use agents to encapsulate business objects which become mobile active software entities, holding all the necessary data (i.e., the business objects) and code (i.e., the behavior) to take action according to the different situations that can occur."
s,"In the age of virtual organizations, managers and experts cease to be lone custodians of the corporate knowledge base. Knowledge must be shared across cultural and time-space boundaries to create strategic frontiers in global and virtual enterprises. However, we believe that organizations have barely scratched the surface of the ""knowledge sharing game"" played across virtual environments. In technology-based organizations, for example, technical knowledge must be meticulously captured and conveyed in a highly cognitive manner to have substantive benefits in raising the competence and productivity of globally-dispersed workers. In this light, we contend that richer forms of knowledge/media representations, such as virtual reality (VR) and 3D imagery, could be creatively utilized to enable improvements in knowledge management, especially within virtual workspace. We further argue that organizational learning evolves to a higher level only when knowledge management is radically improved and effectively exploits ""organizational memory"" with the aid of IT (Stein and Zwass 1995). This paper explores how a technology-based firm, APV Anhydro, has extracted technical knowledge from its experts and creatively presented such knowledge in rich media representations using VR/3D technologies. This enabled APV to share rich technical knowledge across its global marketing operations, and as a consequence, accelerated its organizational learning process."

The objective of this research is to investigate the perceived user perception of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR). The results of this study show a remarkable positive perception of respondents regarding MAR in advertisement and marketing."
w,"In this article we present Ecological Augmented Reality (E-AR), an approach that questions the theoretical assumptions of mainstream Augmented Reality (AR). The development of AR systems to date presupposes an information-processing theory of perception that hinders the potential of the field. Generally, in AR devices, virtual symbolic information is superimposed upon the environment in such a way that the real and the virtual may be processed, informationally speaking, in tandem. Thus, we find information in reality itself, as well as virtual symbolic information. But by increasing the burden of symbolic crunching, AR devices run the risk of saturating the user of the technology. AR systems developed under the principles of an ecological psychology may contribute to new and better levels of performance and adaptation to the user's perceptual abilities. Our proposal is to develop AR devices such that reality itself is augmented non-symbolically by blending real and virtual layers/information. Although there are seldom AR devices in the market that are designed ecologically, two fields of research may well bring inspiration to AR developers. These are the design and manipulation of real objects, and ecological research in the field of sensory substitution. We consider them both in turn with an eye to putting forward a framework that eschews any type of information-processing regarding the nature of our psychological processes. Ultimately, our aim is to provide some guidelines for the exploration of an ecological trend in AR applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

w,"Technological progress in augmented reality (AR) creates new application opportunities for different branches of tourism. The application of modern technology is made possible by the widespread use of mobile devices and dedicated tourist applications. Preliminary market research demonstrates that there are no global solutions intended for tourists on sea voyages that make use of augmented reality. This paper analyzes the use of AR technology in water tourism. The proposed Maritime Educational Trip (MET) system makes it possible to combine geolocation information with the accumulated knowledge of a specific location and to present it with AR. An example prototypical Android application is developed, combining e-navigation with a knowledge base. The developed solutions show how a combination of the real world with a computer-generated world helps to expand the tourism space."
w,"Indoor localization is a basic element in location-based services (LBSs), including seamless indoor and outdoor navigation, location-based precision marketing, spatial recognition in robotics, augmented reality, and mixed reality. The popularity of LBSs in the augmented reality and mixed reality fields has increased the demand for a stable and efficient indoor positioning method. However, the problem of indoor visual localization has not been appropriately addressed, owing to the strict trade-off between accuracy and cost. Therefore, we use point cloud and RGB characteristic information for the accurate acquisition of three-dimensional indoor space. The proposed method is a novel visual positioning system (VPS) capable of determining the user's position by matching the pose information of the object estimated by the improved point-graph neural network (GNN) with the pose information label of a voxel database object addressed in predefined voxel units. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system considering a stationary object in indoor space. The results verify that high positioning accuracy and direction estimation can be efficiently achieved. Thus, spatial information of indoor space estimated using the proposed novel VPS can aid in indoor navigation."

w,"In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) has experienced a great growth in the interest of researchers and general public. Commercial applications such as AR browsers, games, and marketing campaigns are gradually becoming more available; however, the need for a flexible authoring solution still remains. The aim of this paper is to present a novel framework to create marker based augmented reality applications for mobile devices. The framework is composed of five main subsystems: a) presentation: with a game engine as the core component, b) tracking: which performs all the computer vision algorithms, c) interaction: composed of a custom visual editor which processes all the inputs to the framework, d) world model: used to store and provide access to the digital representation of the world, and e) context: used to provide status information of the entire system. All the subsystems were used to provide for users a comprehensive way to develop and share prefabricated objects that allow reusability across applications. A particular case, of an interactive pARabola plotting application, is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the framework. The application was tested in four mobile devices running Android OS. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the framework to create usable mobile AR applications, observing better visual and interaction results on the higher quality mobile devices."
w,"Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging technology that superimposes digital information directly on top of a user's real world view. AR may have great potential for aiding safe marine navigation, however the devices currently available have significant limitations that prevent them from being practical for marine usage. While suitable devices are still a few years away from the market, we propose that research into AR-aided marine navigation can and should be conducted now. Towards this goal, we have developed a virtual reality simulation system that allows us to experiment with a range of possible AR devices and information overlays within a dynamic and highly flexible ship simulation. This strategy avoids challenging registration issues and being tied to any particular prototype AR hardware. The project's goals include identifying the technical specifications required for future AR devices to be useful in navigation, what information is most beneficial to display, and what types of visual representations are best for conveying that information."
w,"Currently, the route planning functions in 2D/3D campus navigation systems in the market are unable to process indoor and outdoor localization information simultaneously, and the UI experiences are not optimal because they are limited by the service platforms. An ARCore-based augmented reality campus navigation system is designed in this paper in order to solve the relevant problems. Firstly, the proposed campus navigation system uses ARCore to enhance reality by presenting 3D information in real scenes. Secondly, a visual inertial ranging algorithm is proposed for real-time locating and map generating in mobile devices. Finally, rich Unity3D scripts are designed in order to enhance users' autonomy and enjoyment during navigation experience. In this paper, indoor navigation and outdoor navigation experiments are carried out at the Lingang campus of Shanghai University of Electric Power. Compared with the AR outdoor navigation system of Gaode, the proposed AR system can achieve increased precise outdoor localization by deploying the visual inertia odometer on the mobile phone and realizes the augmented reality function of 3D information and real scene, thus enriching the user's interactive experience. Furthermore, four groups of students have been selected for system testing and evaluation. Compared with traditional systems, such as Gaode map or Internet media, experimental results show that our system could facilitate the effectiveness and usability of learning on campus."

w,"Augmented reality retail applications (ARRAs) have emerged as rapidly developing innovative and futuristic retail innovation used in both physical store and online shops to improve the retail settings and customer experience. So, the objective of this research was to identify predictors of user benefits of ARRA in the retail food chain. By integrating the theory of information system success model, this study proposes a model to investigate the mediating effect of two values: (1) user satisfaction and (2) user continuance intention between quality perspective as explanatory variables (system, service, and information quality) and user benefits as the outcome variable. Both the mediating factors are found positively playing mediating roles among all proposed relationships. This paper provides valuable course of action for retailers and marketers on assessing customers satisfaction and using ARRA to create marketing strategies effectively."
w,"Food-finding application is an application that provides users with classified and suggestive information about the local food one particular country. Apparently, there are numbers of the food-finding applications in the Malaysia's apps market such as Malaysia Food diary, Hungrygowhere, FoodSpotting etc. However, lacks of classified and suggestive information are the main limitations of the current applications. In order to overcome the limitations of the existing applications, features such as augmented reality, photographic food diary, and smart budget are implemented in the proposed solution. A survey is conducted to understand end-users insights on their usage of food finding application in Malaysia. Based on the gathered evidence, Malaycious is introduced as a new food finding application that bridges the gap of known challenges. Augmented reality (AR) is implemented in the proposed system to enrich users camera feed with contextual information. Users can now benefits from the ability to the place computer generated graphics in the field of vision. Besides that, shooting food becomes one of the fastest growing hobbies for people nowadays. Therefore, the proposed application will include a new feature called Photographic Food Diary to store that pictures that users capture. Therefore, users can recall back the images and also the information of the images. In addition, Smart Budget is a feature that help users to filter the food according to the preferences that user entered. The detail discussion were provided in the relation to the development of Malaycious. Therefore, it can be suggested that Malaycious provide usable and user-friendly food-finding application."
w,"A natural consequence of the extended use of CAD systems for the design and production of any kind of vessel is its use in Virtual Reality environments, mainly because now it has become an accessible technology. Virtual Reality is extended in every industry, in every sector, at any level. Important improvements both in software and hardware have had an important impact in its use in the shipbuilding industry, where it is necessary to handle complex ship 3D models with huge amount of data. So, efficiency is the base condition in the Virtual Reality navigation around a vessel. To enhance it, there are three important factors that play a fundamental role. The first one is having an appropriate CAD system with all the information of the ship in a single data base. The second important issue is to have a viewer, which is a tool that allows the management of the 3D model to be used in Virtual Reality environments. No need to say that a good integration between the viewer and the CAD system will be translated into more functionality and better performance. Finally, the third important player is hardware, which makes possibility the Virtual Reality navigation in many different environments. This paper describes first of all different efficient uses of Virtual Reality in the shipbuilding industry, taking in consideration all the agents involved and describing in particular the advantages for any of them. Regarding the software requirements, it will be described in particular the new FVIEWER, developed by SENER for the Virtual Reality navigation and design review and based on the FORAN system. From the hardware side, it will be described some of the most relevant and feasible applications of the Virtual Reality, taking in consideration potential uses and accessible technology in the market. The future of the Virtual Reality in shipbuilding will be explained after that. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
w,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, borders were closed, cities were blocked, and individuals went into quarantine. The market size of the tourism industry in 2020 declined by more than 70% compared to the previous year, regressing to the size it was 30 years ago. This does not mean that people's needs for tourism have decreased. People started to use virtual reality technologies to get the experience of sightseeing even if they could not go directly to tourist attractions. Prior studies found that virtual reality technology is effective for online shopping and gaming contexts. However, there are insufficient studies investigating the effect of using virtual reality for tourism content. Therefore, this study attempts to verify how the media richness of virtual reality tourism content elicits various reactions from potential tourists in terms of perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, satisfaction, destination visit intention, and positive word-of-mouth intention. The purpose of this study is to verify how virtual reality tourism content increases the destination visit intention after the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on media richness theory and the information system success model, a hypothesis was developed. One hundred and eighty-two data were gathered from potential tourists who were in quarantine by performing an online scenario survey that used quasi-experiment methods. Data were analyzed with a PLS algorithm. The results indicate that media richness of tourism content using virtual reality significantly increased perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. It could significantly increase satisfaction, destination visit intention, and positive word-of-mouth intention. The results of this study explain how information technology can be used in the tourism industry, and they provide suggestions on why tourism content using virtual reality can be useful for attracting tourists, and what experiences it can provide tourists."
w,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism) on the adoption of augmented reality (AR), with a particular focus on the role AR may play in interactive marketing. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative-based approach was followed by a questionnaire survey, which was completed by 230 respondents comprising graduate and postgraduate students, using structural equation modelling. Findings While the trait of openness was positively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms, the trait of neuroticism was negatively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR. Extraversion was positively associated with subjective norms. Perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms were positively associated with attitudes toward AR. Practical implications The data gathered will add a valuable contribution to the currently limited data available on empirical consumer behaviour research, particularly in relation to the adoption of AR for interactive marketing. Originality/value The findings of this study will benefit academics working on the adoption of technology in rapidly developing fields such as automation and artificial intelligence; the study also contributes to the emerging interdisciplinary domain of psychology, information systems, marketing and human behaviour."
w,"The term smart city has recently become greatly widespread in academic and political discourse. Nevertheless, this is rather a marketing term that unites a number of technological (and other) areas: Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), communication networks. The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research. The results of the study can be used in further theoretical and applied research, in the formation of government policy in research and development, as well as in decision-making in the field of urban management."
w,"The transformations provoked in the tourist organizations by the post-digital era, in the procedures of information and acquisition of the tourist services, reflect in the incorporation of new integrating technologies to tourist destinations and enterprises. These technologies direct managers to a new paradigm where there are fewer human interferences and the system is intelligent and interconnected. This new paradigm, called Turismo 4.0, emerges as a way to increase the potential of innovation in the tourism sector, using the main technologies of the Industry 4.0 training, which are: Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Big Data, Data Security, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Autonomous Robots, Cloud and Horizontal and Vertical Integration of Information Technology Systems. This new paradigm establishes a collaborative ecosystem involving local people, local authorities, tourists, service providers and government, co-creating an enriched tourism experience in both the physical and digital worlds. In this sense, it was awakened to the formulation of the following problem question: What are the main debates and studies about management model from the perspective of the digital revolution in the scope of Turismo 4.0? Therefore, this article aimed to analyze the management model of Turismo 4.0, in the context of the digital revolution. For this, it was chosen to carry out a qualitative research, a bibliographical and electronic depth on the subject. In addition, it was decided to carry out a descriptive and exploratory literature review. The procedure of data collection consisted of the survey of relevant articles within the literature on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The databases used were: Go ogle Scholar and Science Direct, with use of specific keywords. The results indicate that there are few studies in this area, and that before so many technologies and advances, it is evident how the Brazilian tourist market is still obsolete in front of this new era. In the end, it was concluded that Industry 4.0 has to prove its benefits to society and only when its technologies, regulations and changes prove to be better for people, should its full potential be realized."
w,"In June 2016, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism issued the report Initiatives for the expansion of shipbuilding exports and regional revitalization through productivity revolution in the maritime industry (i-Shipping). This report sets goals, including achieving a 30% share of the global shipbuilding market by 2025 by utilizing ICT to implement innovation creation and productivity improvements in the maritime industry. In shipbuilding, however, management of things such as piping and related information such as drawings takes an enormous amount of time. To resolve this issue, a system for identifying things and associating them with information through the use of markers is required. Fujitsu made use of augmented reality (AR) technology to develop a piping management system for improving work productivity, including the design, manufacturing, sorting, and installation of piping. In this system, a tablet computer can be held toward an AR marker affixed to an individual pipe to input work records and view installation and other drawings required for work, allowing the reduction of required person-hours. This paper describes the construction of the piping system for Fukuoka Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. as an example of Fujitsu's approach to productivity improvement at a shipbuilding site."
w,"The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed 'Paludiculture') present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing 'green' eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from 'brown to green' must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the 'Industry 5.0 -a human-centric solution'. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation."

w,"Prior to an excavation for a construction project, fieldwork is necessary to identify the location of all underground utilities. There is a demand for identifying the accurate positioning of the underground utilities, in order to support the contractors in avoiding damages to existing underground infrastructures. Such damages could cost thousands of euros, needless to underline the danger in human lives, in the presence of gas and electricity. There is a concrete market request for solutions that are able to effectively handle underground utilities' data and function in support to the fieldwork. The fusion of technologies such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), sensors, geographic information systems (GIS) and geodatabases, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) can lead to products and services for monitoring, documenting and managing the utility-based geospatial data. The LARA project, a H2020 co-funded project by the European Commission (EC), embraced these needs and developed a software and hardware (S/H) system. The LARA hand-held and mobile device involves state-of-the-art technologies in the domain of positioning and sensors, AR and 3D GIS geodatabases and aids the users in seeing beneath the ground by rendering the complexity of the 3D utilities' models. The visualization of underground utilities is made using a mixed reality paradigm, where the user can see at the same time the surroundings and the utilities rendered at their exact location in 3D. In order to cope with the end-users expectations, two types of visualizations have been implemented and tested. LARA system tested in two case studies during the project lifetime and the results are promising."
w,"Currently, companies in the industrial sector are focusing their efforts on incorporating the advances contained in the Industry 4.0 model, to continue competing in an increasingly high-tech market. These advances, in addition to productivity, have a remarkable impact on the working environment of workers and on the measures adopted to maintain a healthy workspace. Thus, for example, there are projects to develop augmented reality technologies for maintenance and industrial training, advanced modelling tools for additive manufacturing, or Big Data analysis platforms for industrial data. However, the solutions designed are too specific to a particular industry problem or the platforms proposed are too generalist and not easily adaptable to the industries. This work seeks to provide a reference software architecture at the service of the connected industry that allows the provision of new capacities for process optimisation, predictive maintenance and real-time visualisation, integrating all the relevant information generated by the existing systems, incorporating new sources of data resulting from the digital society, and ensuring future compatibility with the new sources of information, solutions and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices that may be implemented.The platform provides a reduction of time and effort invested in extracting the necessary information for the optimisation of the processes."
w,"Digitalization of production environment, also called Industry 4.0, the term invented by Prof. Wahlster in Germany, is now one of the hottest topics in the software/hardware engineering departments at universities and companies. It splits to many subtopics and technologies. One of the most interesting concerns Augmented Reality glasses - giving a very natural human-machine interface - possibility to present the needed information right in front of user's eyes and ability to communicate with the system by simple gestures and voice. To show the long-lasting need of convenient presentation of information, authors show different examples in different markets, but then, concentrate on one example around the production maintenance team. The point of this paper is the AR system usability evaluation - as noted by scientists around the world note, in-depth studies about the effects of AR applications are sparse. In the first part of this paper, authors recall the concept presented in 2018 about the new method of monitoring the production line with the AR glasses. In the second part, there is a description of conducted study for this concept, carried out in the real production environment on the real production process.

w,"Purpose In modern e-commerce and omnichannel management, consumers can utilize visual information delivered by augmented reality interactive technology (ARIT) to relate to products and view them worn on themselves. Accordingly, ARIT is increasingly common in online retail environments because this dynamicproduct imagery decreases the gap between online and offline shopping. On the basis of construal-level theory (CLT), this study not only examines the system characteristics that impact the perceived ease of use and usefulness of ARIT but also explores how these system characteristics can successfully affect online consumers to adopt ARIT in retail settings. Design/methodology/approach In this study, ARIT is applied mainly in an online clothes fitting context. By conducting a task-based laboratory study, 344 valid samples were collected. Structure equation modeling (SEM) was employed for further analysis. Findings Navigation structure, graphic style and information content were identified as the three system characteristics that affect perceived ease of use and usefulness of ARIT. Of the three characteristics, information content has the greatest impact on perceived ease of use and usefulness of ARIT. The study also found that navigation structure, graphic style and information content all shape ARIT system characteristics, and this explains and predicts the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use effect better than any original single system characteristic. Originality/value Interactive marketing research indicates that the influence of immediately visualizing consumer-product matching effects creates excitement, arouses emotions and triggers curiosity to explore additional product purchase experiences. This study contributes to the present body of knowledge of the concept of ARIT systems. This is a pioneer research that uses CLT to act as a crucial psychological mechanism that dominates online fitting and apparel appraisal for consumers using ARIT. This study serves as a reference for designing and employing multisensory ARIT applications in interactive marketing to drive online sales."
w,"The first in vehicle instrument was the speedometer. It was invented by Otto Schulze in 1902. Until then, drivers had to estimate their speed. The speedometer was followed by an alcohol temperature gauge. A few warning lamps surveyed the most important vehicle functions. Later, single gauges like radiator temperature, fuel gauge, and revolution counter were added to the instrumentation. They were superseded by instrument clusters combining several instruments in one housing. Even though the appearance of the instrument cluster did not change significantly from the early days, there was a steady development of the intelligence behind the panel. This huge amount of information could only be handled by graphic displays. When navigation systems came into our cars, a larger graphic display was needed. It found place in the center console. In parallel, the price decline in the computer market and the availability of high-performing graphic hardware and software made it possible to enhance the classical functions of the instrument board to an interactive multifunctional information panel, with the dashboard being the main interface between car and driver. The windshield was the third zone where information could be placed in a favorable reading position minimizing eyes off the road time. As a consequent evolution step, augmented reality head-up displays will soon dominate the information center of premium-class vehicles."
w,"The use of virtual reality (VR) in Marketing research and practice is blooming, which suggests that Marketing can largely benefit from VR applications. In multidisciplinary applications of technology, it is important to organize the results of current studies and to define the terminology to subsidize future studies.

w,"Pokemon Go is one of the most successful mobile games of all time. Millions played and still play this mobile augmented reality (AR) application, although severe privacy issues are pervasive in the app due to its use of several sensors such as location data and camera. In general, individuals regularly use online services and mobile apps although they might know that the use is associated with high privacy risks. This seemingly contradictory behavior of users is analyzed from a variety of different perspectives in the information systems domain. One of these perspectives evaluates privacy-related decision making processes based on concepts from behavioral economics. We follow this line of work by empirically testing one exemplary extraneous factor within the enhanced APCO model (antecedents-privacy concerns-outcome). Specific empirical tests on such biases are rare in the literature which is why we propose and empirically analyze the extraneous influence of a positivity bias. In our case, we hypothesize that the bias is induced by childhood brand nostalgia towards the Pokemon franchise. We analyze our proposition in the context of an online survey with 418 active players of the game. Our results indicate that childhood brand nostalgia influences the privacy calculus by exerting a large effect on the benefits within the trade-off and, therefore, causing a higher use frequency. Our work shows two important implications. First, the behavioral economics perspective on privacy provides additional insights relative to previous research. However, the effects of several other biases and heuristics have to be tested in future work. Second, relying on nostalgia represents an important, but also double-edged, instrument for practitioners to market new services and applications."

w,"This study examines the essential characteristics of Virtual Reality (VR) that influence individual visit intention towards a touristic product. Despite the extensive research about VR, however, only little has examined the impact of factors that alter customers' attitudes and trigger purchasing intention. This study applied Information Systems Success Model and conducted a survey using the convenience sampling method with international tourists who visited North Cyprus. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, and findings demonstrated that VR has great potential to influence visitors' final destination by promoting tourism products and services. This paper revealed that VR-as a marketing medium-creates positive impacts and stimulates individuals' intentions to visit a destination. The study provides implications for tourism sector actors such as tourism planners, policymakers, travel agencies, and hotel managers as well as prosocial guest experience to improve their marketing strategies."
w,"Information technologies have offered new possibilities of the development of the market of tourist services and led to the creation of various client oriented information systems in the museum business. Museums have started to introduce information technologies in the sphere of accounting, storage and research into collections, to use multimedia, which include both traditional static visual information and dynamic information (such as speech, music, video footage and animation). TicketNet has helped greatly to attract more visitors. QR-codes revolutionized the museum business. Nowadays all museums have their own websites and experts believe that the number of virtual visitors will exceed the number of real ones in the near future. Therefore, scientists face a new problem of researching both negative and positive consequences of cultural heritage transfer into virtual reality. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
w,"The main application of virtual reality (VR) is to immerse users in the three-dimensional simulation environment and experience the virtual reality world. At present, VR products and content on the market have some problems to be solved, such as location information error, dizziness and discomfort, stereo vision error, sound mismatch and so on. Moreover, most VR applications use stereo vision perception, but that alone is not enough to fully immerse users in the VR environment. For a long time, the single way of information transmission makes people over rely on the visual channel, which leads to visual information overload. Compared with the receptive visual information obtained by a single channel, haptic interaction system is more bidirectional. The employment of tactile feedback technology in VR can provide better immersion and interaction, and expand the scope of user experience. Among the four main tactile stimuli-vibrant stimulus, pressure stimulus, electric stimulus and temperature stimulus, vibrant stimulus has higher comfort, consistency and better response speed and adjustable range. Therefore in this paper, combinedwith specificVRscene, external vibration was applied around the eyes to provide periocular stimulation, so as to explore the role of vibration in enhancing the immersion of VR equipments. A mathematical model of human visual-haptic interaction process is established, and it is verified that the artificial neural network model has good fitting effect in simulating human visual-haptic nervous system."
w,"In recent years, depth sensing systems have gained popularity and have begun to appear on the consumer market. Of these systems, PMD-based Time-of-Flight cameras are the smallest available and will soon be integrated into mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. Like all other available depth sensing systems, PMD-based Time-of-Flight cameras do not produce perfect depth data. Because of the sensor's characteristics, the data is noisy and the resolution is limited. Fast movements cause motion artifacts, which are undefined depth values due to corrupted measurements. Combining the data of a Time-of-Flight and a color camera can compensate these flaws and vastly improve depth image quality. This work uses color edge information as a guide so the depth image is upscaled with resolution gain and lossless noise reduction. A novel depth upscaling method is introduced, combining the creation of high quality depth data with fast execution. A high end smart phone development board, a color, and a Time-of-Flight camera are used to create a sensor fusion prototype. The complete processing pipeline is efficiently implemented on the graphics processing unit in order to maximize performance. The prototype proves the feasibility of our proposed fusion method on mobile devices. The result is a system capable of fusing color and depth data at interactive frame rates. When there is depth information available for every color pixel, new possibilities in computer vision, augmented reality and computational photography arise. The evaluation shows, our sensor fusion solution provides depth images with upscaled resolution, increased sharpness, less noise, less motion artifacts, and achieves high frame rates at the same time; thus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions."
w,"In the digital era, virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized the museum experience, redefining how visitors engage with cultural artifacts and exhibits. This research investigates the profound impact of VR on museums, specifically focusing on its influence on visitor satisfaction, loyalty, and the democratization of cultural heritage. By combining the information systems (IS) success model, flow theory, and the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) model, this study offers a comprehensive framework to analyze the complex dynamics of VR integration within museums. The findings reveal that visitor satisfaction and loyalty are closely linked to the quality of information, system functionality, and aesthetic appeal in VR-enhanced museum spaces. Flow experience serves as a mediating factor, elucidating the psychological underpinnings of visitor engagement and the attainment of positive outcomes. By evaluating dimensions such as information quality (IQ), system quality (SQ), aesthetic quality (AQ), flow experience (FE), visitor satisfaction (VS), and visitor loyalty (VL), this research provides practical recommendations for museums seeking to thrive in the digital age. Also, the study explores the global accessibility facilitated by VR, making cultural collections accessible to diverse audiences and expanding the influence of museums worldwide. The research emphasizes the importance of information systems management and marketing strategies in maximizing the benefits of VR-enhanced museum experiences, ultimately leading to greater visitor satisfaction. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of VR's impact on museums and calls for strategic interventions to ensure the continued relevance and growth of museums in the digital era."
w,"Finding products and items in large online space that meet user needs is difficult. Time spent searching before finding a relevant item can be a significant time sink for users. As with other economic branches, growing Internet usage also changed user behavior in the real-estate market. Advancements in virtual reality offer virtual tours and interactive map and floor plans which make an online rental websites very popular among users. With the abundance of information, recommender systems become more important than ever to give the user relevant property suggestions and reduce search time. A sophisticated recommender in this domain can help reduce the need of a real-estate agent. Session-based user behavior and lack of user profiles leads to the use of traditional recommendation methods. In this research, we propose an approach for real-estate recommendation based on Gated Orthogonal Recurrent Unit (GORU) and Weighted Cosine Similarity. GORU captures the user search context and weighted cosine similarity improves the rank of pertinent property. We have used the data of an online public real estate web portal (AARZ.PK). The data represents the original behavior of the user on an online portal. We have used Recall, User coverage and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metrics for the evaluation of our system against other state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed solution outperforms various baselines and state-of-the-art RNN based solutions."
w,"In everyday life, in advance to an excavation project, there is an actual prerequisite and a by regulation in many countries, to pinpoint all the underground utilities located in the project's area. In addition, it is so crucial for the clients, the public and private utilities, to have a real representation of the water, electricity, gas, sewerage, etc. underground networks. As the practice shows, there is a constant and growing demand for the accurate positioning of the underground utilities in order to facilitate both the utilities' and the construction companies avoid damages to the existing infrastructure. Such a damage may cause a loss of thousands of euros. It is true that many problems may arise when the digging machine operator starts digging the ground, but the most dangerous is the gas line explosions, fires or even electrocution in electric lines, water lines bursts, etc. This can be very dangerous for all the field workers in the project's area but also for the property owners; even for the people just passing nearby the area. At the same time, such a development is extremely costly either for the public or the private company or for both. For years now there is a tangible market request for solutions that are able to effectively handle underground utilities' geospatial data and support the missions of utilities and construction companies in the real working environment. Innovative and edge technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), sensors, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geodatabases, Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) can be used for monitoring, documenting and managing the utility-based geospatial and other data. In addition to this, these technologies are able to offer an intuitive 3D augmented visualization and navigation/positioning environment that can support anyone interested in the field. LARA project, a H2020 co-funded project by the European Commission, eavesdrops these market needs and now is developing a software and hardware-based system called LARA. Understanding the real market necessities of the utilities and construction players, a group of partners, from academia and research, SMEs and end users, is implementing this multidisciplinary project. Within LARA project, the consortium partners are evolving a mobile (tablet) device to support the utility management professionals and workers on the field and under real conditions. The LARA hand-held and mobile device is incorporating state-of-the-art technologies in the domain of positioning and sensors (GNSS), AR and 3D GIS geo-databases. The vision of LARA system is to guide the utility field workers in their daily business; to help them 'see' beneath the ground by rendering the complexity of the 3D models of the underground grid such as water, gas, sewerage and electricity. The notion is to integrate the novel components of existing technologies so as to develop an integrated navigation/positioning and information system which coordinates GNSS, AR, 3D GIS and geodatabases on a mobile platform for monitoring, documenting and managing utility infrastructures on-site. In practice, the first prototype is ready and the forthcoming period it will be tested in the real environment. The ability and profits from the LARA system use, will be tested in two case studies scheduled during project lifetime. The two pilot applications are scheduled in Kozani (Greece) and the United Kingdom (Birmingham) with various underground utilities. The methodology for system testing has already been defined while the first results from the pilot application (Kozani, Greece) are coming the forthcoming period."
w,"To meet changing business and market requirements many businesses opt for digital transformation, a process entailing the integration of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Information systems, Big Data, etc. into all their business practices. Covid-19 pandemic urged companies worldwide to engage in digital transformation for reasons of survival, competitiveness, and adaption to the emerged conditions. The present study investigates the engagement of small Greek companies into digital transformation process during the Covid-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire was used as a research tool and was distributed throughout Greece. The collected data showed that digital transformation is still in its early stages in Greece, although Greek entrepreneurs consider it a key element to make their businesses viable. A future study, with a bigger sample and more research tools, when Covid-19 pandemic ends, might contribute to a better understanding of digital transformation process in Greece under circumstances different than those of a pandemic crisis."
w,"Consumer-level Virtual Reality (VR) hardware/software has undergone rapid developments in recent years. Its potential use in the meat industry for meat cut planning has yet to be reported. In this communication, we introduce a VR system based on a VR goggle (Oculus Rift) and a hand motion sensor. A lamb carcass's musculoskeletal model (or atlas) is imported into an immersive virtual environment, created by a 3D VR engine (Unity3D). Virtual resection is performed by using a virtual knife operating on the virtual atlas as per standard meat cut specifications of New Zealand. The procedure yields instant volume and weight information of each primary and retail meat cut. We suggest that the VR system can potentially be used in a high-volume slaughterhouse for meat-cut planning and marketing decisions."
w,"The increasing adoption of three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality technologies in business practices requires an interdisciplinary research approach to study their effect. In this paper we investigate the effects of different 3D online store layouts on user perceptions in the e-retailing context. We build on recent research on store atmosphere that classifies store layouts in 3D environments as avant-garde, warehouse, pragmatic, boutique and department. Reflecting the dual identity of individuals as both consumers visiting virtual stores and users interacting with graphical user interfaces, we employ key constructs from both the marketing and the information systems literature to build our research model. The study measures how Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Merchandise Quality Perception and Store Perception vary across the distinct store layouts. We employ a laboratory experiment in the apparel industry to test our model. Our results show that the layouts lead to different perceptions, although the consumers' Shopping Motivation does not moderate this effect. Building on the differences found on store layout effects on user/consumer behavior in the 3D online context, the paper discusses relevant research and practical implications."
w,"Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and three dimensional (3D) World Wide Web (WWW) applications usage are on the rise. The demand for online 3D terrain visualization for GIS data has increased. Current users demand for more complex data which have higher accuracy and realism. This is aided by the emergence of geo-browsers in the market which provide free service and also cater for the commercialized market. Other new technology driving the market is the use of software such as CityGML, Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML)/ Entensive 3D (X3D), geoVRML, and Keyhole Markup Language (KML). These technologies also play an important role for this new era of online 3D terrain visualization. The aim of this paper is to implement the online 3D terrain visualization for GIS data by using VRML technology and launching the system into three different web servers. The data used for this system are contour data and high resolution satellite image (QUICKBIRD) for Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) area. Testing was done only for satellite image overlaid to 3D terrain data. The web servers used in this experiment were the Spatial Research Group Server in UPM, Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) web server, and ruzinoor.my web server. The comparison was based on the performance of web servers in terms of accessibility, uploading time, CPU usage, frame rate per second (fps), and number of users. The results from this experiment will be of help and guidance to the developers in finding the right web servers for the best performance on implementing online 3D terrain visualization for GIS data."
w,"In many everyday purchase decisions, consumers have to trade-off their decisions between alternatives. For example, consumers often have to decide whether to buy the more expensive high quality product or the less expensive product of lower quality. Marketing researchers are especially interested in finding out how consumers make decisions when facing such trade-off conflicts and eye-tracking has been used as a tool to investigate the allocation of attention in such situations. Conflicting decision situations are also particularly interesting for human-computer interaction research because designers may use knowledge about the information acquisition behavior to build assistance systems which can help the user to solve the trade-off conflict. In this paper, we build and test such an assistance system that monitors the user's information acquisition processes using mobile eye-tracking in the virtual reality. In particular, we test whether and how strongly the tradeoff conflict influences how consumers direct their attention to products and features. We find that trade-off conflict, task experience and task involvement significantly influence how much attention products receive. We discuss how this knowledge might be used in the future to build assistance systems in the form of attentive smart glasses."
w,"Usability and trust have been observed to be related in several domains including web retail, information systems, and e-health. Trust in technology reflects beliefs about the attributes of a technology. Research has shown that trust is a key factor for the success of different systems - e.g., e-market, e-commerce, and social networks. Trust in technology can be supported or prevented by the perceived usability. Therefore, a low level of usability could compromise an individual's trust in their use of a technology, resulting in a negative attitude towards a product. Even if this relationship has been seen as important in the fields listed above, there is limited research which empirically assesses trust and usability in virtual reality (VR). This work will present the first set of data on the relationship between usability and trust in VR. To gather this data, three different VR systems (Desktop 3D tool, CAVE, and a flight simulator) were tested. The findings show that (i) the best-known questionnaire to measure usability and trust could be applied to VR, (ii) there is a strong relationship between people's satisfaction and trust in the use of VR, (iii) the relationship between usability and trust exists for different systems."
w,"We discuss the impact of information and communication technologies, extending to more complex devices and industrial systems. Intelligent systems and its market counterpoint disclosed as intelligent systems, are presented. Academic texts on artificial intelligence are referenced as a conceptual basis for sustaining the social impacts of smart technologies expansion or disclosed as well. Questions about thinking and searching for solutions using the game of chess as a comparison between humans and computers, seeking to shed light on the mental processes that are related to intelligent behavior. We question the reliance or trust of people in more complex decisions to leave such devices or systems, from simple arithmetic to inferences and propose strategic actions, through the interaction between humans and intelligent systems to improve the efficiency of tasks complex as a whole. Finally, reflective questions are posed about the real possibility of artificial intelligence supplant humans, creating a virtual reality and how technology can currently be creating this reality and a new form of dependency."
w,"Digital humanities are unfamiliar words in Taiwan. With the popularity of digital technology and mobile computing, Digital Human Geography in both theory and practice have emerged many new potentials and development opportunities. However, the research field regarding digital human geography can cover many areas, such as: mobile augmented reality, local media and service design, urban space interaction, virtual mixed space, space humanistic experience, historical materials reproduction, creativity of digital local sense, cultural narrative and art experience, local action games, mobile learning, and location-related business applications etc. This study aims to transfer information to specific groups through a simple and straightforward manner. With digital technology in combination with humane digital contents, people under the scenario of interactive interface are allowed to apply geographic information system (GIS) and geo-fencing program to convert data into visual images and through today's Infographics to clearly use visual design characteristics in content presentation. Therefore, our study was to develop a new App, called Ai Guang Zhan. People can use Ai Guang Zhan App to integrate all exhibition related services. The App can be downloaded from smartphone or tablet PC for users to search in any time the arts and cultural activities and public facilities in the nearest place and receive instant mobile navigation services among various cultural and creative parks. To understand the preference and satisfaction by the people who use the UI interface for the APP designed from the study, a random questionnaire survey will be conducted in Huashan Cultural and Creative Industry Park and Songshan Cultural and Creative Park. The survey results will be used as reference for function improvement of next APP version. The primary purpose of this research is to propose a model for the development of applications, as well as methods for a clearer and easier visual presentation of information to be used as a reference for practitioners or application designers. The application, developed by the study through the proposed processes, was found to be effective; the developed application could be utilized as a new and useful tool to facilitate the utilization of academic and cultural resources. Additionally, users' specific comments and suggestions collected by the study could be adopted as a reference for future application development. The application developed by this study was found to serve effectively as a method to promote the development of art and cultural activities of all sizes in various regions, and stimulate the exchange of arts and humanities between urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the application has the ability to attract younger people to participate in art and cultural activities, find their own interests, and explore more corresponding activities with its assistance. Future applications associated to art and cultural activities are suggested to effectively integrate AR, GIS, and visual design (such as Infographics) technologies, and thereby offer users more diversified, convenient, and useful functions. Restricted by the resources of labor and limited time, the functional design and development of the application still requires improvement. Specifically, the combination of AR technology and information presentation of art and cultural activities, as well as the calculation of relative distance and travel time were not presented effectively. The next step of the project would involve revising the content and functionalities of the application based on users' feedback collected by this study, reviewing the acceptance of market responses of the application, and seeking a development company or foundation for technology transfer. Moreover, we intend to combine more technologies such as diversified cross-platform functions, visualized design of information, and interactive devices to further improve the application, and thereby stimulate social, human, and geographical interactions."
w,"The primary purpose of this review is to answer three research questions: 1) What are the most popular features of physical activity (PA) tracking and recording mobile applications (apps); 2) what features drive the app cost, peak rank, or gross sales; and 3) to what extent are evidence-based weight loss recommendations used in PA apps? Two hundred top grossing iOS health care and fitness apps were screened using a systematic review method. Fifty-five apps met the criteria as PA tracking and recording apps. Nearly half of these iOS PA apps are also -available in Android. Two separate reviewers evaluated each PA app using 48 features. The top three most popular features are the use of behavioral strategies, use of the FITT Principles -(frequency, -intensity, time, type), and the use of the Principles for Physical Fitness. Free apps contain a mean of nine of the ten most popular features in paid apps, making them good bargains in PA -promotion. Better peak rank is associated with the use of Fitness Principles, weight loss goal setting, or training videos. Ten PA apps met at least four of eight of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations for weight loss and prevention of weight regain for adults. The least popular features were PA safety and workouts for special need populations. Implications for obesity treatment are discussed in relationship to individual end-users, health care providers, and app developers. Because current PA apps still lack validity and compliance to standards for PA safety and data security, medical consultation for weight loss is recommended. The quality of PA apps on the market will improve through innovative support from the government, industry, and academia. The future of PA apps is bright, especially with the potential of using emerging technologies that involve low-cost wearable sensors, global information systems, and immersive technology such as virtual worlds and virtual reality."
w,"Rural tourism plays an important role in advancing the rural economy but faces unexpected risks and challenges such as the deterioration of operational performance. Information and communications technologies (ICT) - such as digital payment platforms, online booking systems, social media marketing, and virtual reality tours - become pervasive in the tourism industry during the current digital era. However, little empirical evidence has been presented about how such technologies impact rural tourism and if rural tourism resilience gets enhanced with the support of ICT in China. This study addresses this research gap by analyzing a sample of 20,716 rural tourism operators from the Third National Agricultural Census of 2016 in Beijing, which is a major urban center in China with a substantial market for rural tourism products and services. With the aid of a treatment effect model (TEM), the research results show that ICT can be an effective way to promote the rural tourism industry through mitigating business difficulties and risks and therefore to enhance the resilience of rural tourism. Our study shows that ICT plays an important and positive role in promoting tourism sales externally and enhancing management internally. The heterogeneity of the operator's organization type and human capital also makes a difference. The sample data robustly show that ICT can effectively alleviate scale discrimination and support low education level bias, which is conducive to small-scaled business households and has also increased the resilience of those operators who are at a disadvantaged position in the industry."
w,"current source space communication architecture has not changed. At present, the key technology of so-called metaverse media only applies its elements to existing communication architectures, and more importantly, this type of integration involves individual examples and promotional marketing methods. How to become a new growth point for the deep collaborative development of metaverse media requires strengthened research and exploration. Although AI analysis technology is powerful, its sensitivity, accuracy and adaptability could be more satisfactory due to the complexity of real-world scenarios. Given the shortcomings of existing research, we designed a video analysis system in the metaverse environment, combining virtual reality and artificial intelligence, with video perception, network, and information technology as the medium and big data as the technical support to build a full intelligence Video analysis system. The system is based on the YOLOv3 model, combined with the actual video scene, and analyzes according to the video's human behavior and environmental changes. Experiments show that the system has obvious advantages in the accuracy and recall rate of video analysis and detection, the system detection performance is significantly improved, and the video target analysis and detection of complex scenes are realized."
w,"The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies in the digital transformation market. A digital twin is a virtual copy of a physical system that emulates its behaviour to predict failures and opportunities for change, prescribe actions in real-time, and optimise and/or mitigate unexpected events. Modelling the virtual copy of a physical system is a rather complex task and requires the availability of a large amount of information and a set of accurate models that adequately represent the reality to model. At present, the modelling depends on the specific use case. Hence, the need to design a modelling solution suitable for virtual reality modelling in the context of a digital twin. The paper proposes a new approach to design a DT by endeavouring the concept of modelling patterns and their invariance property. Modelling patterns are here thought of as data-driven, as they can be derived autonomously from data using a specific approach devised to reach an invariance feature, to allow these to be used (and re-used) in modelling situations and/or problems with any given degree of similarity. The potentialities of invariance modelling patterns are proved here by the grace of a real industrial application, where a dedicated DT has been built using the approach proposed here."
w,"In China's modern market economy under the rapid development of the general situation, we work more and more problems, and work pressure is also increasing. The so-called office space refers to the space layout, style, and the physical and psychological division of the space. Office space must take into account many factors, involving technology, technology, humanities, aesthetics, and other elements, while the office space is the space where people work and relax. In recent years, as people's requirements for the work environment are increasingly high, therefore, the design of the office space is also more and more attention to people. The concept of soft furnishing design into the work space will help improve the overall corporate and office space design of cultural taste which is one of the main methods to show the quality and human connotation of the enterprise. The three-dimensional reconstruction refers to the creation of a mathematical model suitable for computer display and processing of three-dimensional space objects. It is an important basic tool for data processing, computing, and researching the performance of mathematical models in the computer environment, which can be applied in various fields such as autonomous navigation of mobile robots, aviation and remote sensing computing, industrial monitoring information system, medical imaging, and virtual reality. The 3D environment reconstruction technology has become one of the popular research areas in computer vision and increasingly attracts the attention of design practitioners. This paper takes the 3D environment reconstruction technology of office space soft decoration design as the basis and discusses the important elements and modeling ideas in soft decoration design, which adds to the interior design of office space, and uses Kinect to obtain the depth data in the 3D environment, so as to complete the realistic 3D reproduction of the interior environment based on computer vision technology."
w,"Purpose - Despite the perceived benefits of implementing virtual reality (VR) training in elite sport, arguably the most important element - the perceptions of practitioners - has been largely understudied. Therefore, the present study aims to explore practitioners' perceptions of VR training in elite football and baseball, with a focus on the important factors, obstacles, perceived knowledge and practical use of the technology. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach measuring practitioner perceptions via an online questionnaire was adopted. Football respondents (n = 25) represented practitioners from major football leagues across the world, and baseball respondents (n = 15) represented practitioners from Major League Baseball. Findings - Both football and baseball respondents reported that the most important factor for implementation of VR training was improvement in on-field performance (technical and tactical); whilst cost was viewed as the biggest obstacle. Both football and baseball respondents also noted that the most likely group to receive VR training would be injured and rehabilitating athletes. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that football respondents perceived coach (p = 0.02) and executive approval (p < 0.001) as significantly greater obstacles than baseball respondents. Originality/value - This research provides novel and invaluable information for stakeholders within VR regarding what the elite organisations of different sports perceive as the most important factors for implementation, as well as greatest obstacles preventing use. This information should guide future development and marketing of VR training systems in sport."
w,"During an Information Architecture course at our university, students designed and created a system of e-health environments as a set of an e-health promotion services developed for a library and prepared in MaxWhere 3D virtual reality spaces. They had to define the goals of their environments, the target groups, they had to organize the pieces of information for having an impact on their future users. During the design process, they had to use their knowledge about marketing, psychology, information architecture and library and information science. Here we present three environments that were designed for using them in an imaginary library in 2025. One of them could be applied in the library of the Institute of Sport Science as well as of the Faculty of Public Health. This huge environment contains various topics in this area. The student applied many media types, online services and designed applications that probably will exist in the near future. An important point of view was to provide useful, important, reliable and up-to-date information for the users of the target group. The overall goal of the research was to develop some cognitive skills of the students: inventive and innovative thinking. In this paper, we demonstrate some results of this research: the design and development of the e-Health Promotion VR service."
w,"Due to the growth in the amount and types of information that surrounds us, it is important to explore other areas and ideas and ways to interact with information. Haptic systems with their tactile, kinesthetic and motor capabilities, together with the associated cognitive processes, present a bidirectional channel of information to our brain. This channel provides a way to interact with the information with which a large number of applications can be generated. Haptics covers many disciplines; Therefore, a wide variety of applications is generated that includes those areas of human needs such as products, manufacturing, education, health, among others. For teleoperation and virtual reality applications, force feedback is important for the user, since due to this it can improve the interaction between the user's real environment and the virtual environment. For this reason, the human hand is capable of obtaining information while executing complex tasks. This has a variety of functions among the most important are the sensory and motor functions. That is why there is an interest in creating a haptic device for the hand. Haptic research and technology have created and evaluated different prototypes with their characteristics and capabilities for the use of virtual environments, some of which are currently marketed. In this way, different applications of this technology have been made in areas such as: graphical interface, medicine, games, engineering, telerobotics, simulators and medical rehabilitators. Focusing on the haptic interface for the upper limbs with force feedback, the process of integrating exoskeletons and haptic interface is a great advance to be able to transmit force to the joints of the hand. Traditional methods for the rehabilitation of patients with motor disabilities in the upper limbs are slow, costly and in many cases ineffective, considerably reducing their quality of life. Therefore, it seeks to develop a low-cost haptic force feedback technology with its three main elements: a haptic device, a computer where a virtual environment (interface) is generated, and a human operator that closes the loop, which complements the recovery of these patients and thus achieve better results. Previous studies that integrate 3D printing technologies, virtual reality (VR), microcontrollers and actuation through tensors demonstrate the successful development of different prototypes with similar characteristics, although most of them are expensive. For the development of the prototype, the V methodology was used, performing instrumentation, interface- prototype connection and force feedback tests. The integration of these subsystems after the tests, result in a final prototype of the haptic glove for two fingers ( index and middle) of the right hand, managing to generate feedback forces on the user based on the information provided by the interface, complying with the characteristics of being a functional and low-cost glove."
w,"In the past decade during IEEE sponsored professional meetings(2),(3) the theme of Global Health Transformation through true Interoperability was brought to the forefront in the inaugural keynotes. Some technologies that started with the monitoring of hemodynamic variables of astronauts by NASA in the 60s were further developed by the Department of Defense for the purposes of treating their injured in the battlefield via Telemedicine. By August 511, 1997 President Clinton signed the first piece of legislation that was allowing the concepts of homecare to be tried to measure cost and medical effectiveness. With the development of Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW), social media, intelligent agents, mobile technology, sensors, and pieces of clothing containing them a new generation of devices have been created offering new possibilities for improvements particularly in areas such assist of living (for those suffering from chronic conditions), and homecare in general. The use of wearable computing in general and the use of augmented reality in the developed world in particular offer some unique opportunities to improve outcomes. In the 21(st) Century and as the Health Care and Public Health infrastructure intersect deeper into the many Information Technology (IT) subfields, abundant and formidable changes can occur that will allow society to shift current systems into some where wellness and disease prevention will be the focus. Many changes can affect positively medical and cost effective outcomes as well as the elimination of medical errors and patient safety for example. In these arenas, with the convergence of science, technology and with Information Technology acting as a catalyst for change, health care systems around the world are slowly shifting from -hospital based ones into distributed systems that include: hospitals, clinics, homecare systems with treatment and management of chronic diseases for the elderly via Internet, etc. In order to achieve such visions, multiple efforts have been tried for creating electronic health record as well as the information highway for their use. In the US the health system is very scattered and most hospital systems do not contain for example mental health, dental health and or vaccine registry information. On one hand through major medical research the emergence of clinical and health data repositories or Intelligent Data Warehouses that not only include traditional clinical data, but also advanced imaging, molecular medicine, tissue micro-array analysis and other bioinformatics information is available. These increasingly multi-modality data warehouses are constantly updated, continuously expanded and populated with millions of records. Although these repositories of electronic information can be leveraged not only to improve point of care clinical decision-making for individual patients, they can also support population health chronic and infectious disease analytics (i.e., epidemiology and surveillance), cost efficient multi-center (e.g., and multi-country) clinical trials, and comprehensive post-market pharmaco-vigilance. On the other hand the integration of healthcare and public health is a major concern as well. Globalization (i.e., the interdependencies that each country has with many others) for example has raised the sense of awareness through the information highway. In 2004 the total production of flu vaccines coming to the US from the UK's Chiron had to be thrown away (approximately in the range of 42 to 44 million vaccines). During and since 2007 the US public has learnt through successive media stories related to: the death of pets due to food-import contamination, children's toys imports containing lead paint, food contamination, drug contamination, drug ingredients contaminated, etc. During 2008 we heard about: People getting very sick from fish containing the ciguatera toxin and Tab / drinking water containing about 36 different medications, e.g., antibiotics, antidepressants, etc. As the northern hemisphere prepared for the second wave of the 2009 H1N1 Flu Pandemic (which was expected to start around October 2009) all nations could have benefited by having epidemiology and surveillance data from all southern hemisphere nations available for the production of more accurate vaccines. In 2011 the European Union had to cut back in their consumption of vegetables and fruit because of an e-coli outbreak. Simultaneously the food from Asia in sonic cases was contaminated with radiation from the nuclear disaster caused by the combination of earthquake / tsunami at the Fukushima site. In South America the eruption of the volcano Puyehue in Chile closed all the airports in Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and the south of Brazil. All of these events resulted in major conflicts regarding world demand for food supplies. Still the perfect opportunity to transform our health care systems to a strategy of disease prevention and wellness is in the horizon. Using information technology as an enabler, we can encompass a wide range of opportunities that can start at the cellular, molecular and genetics levels and go as far as population health. Initial immunization studies show the level of antibody titers against viral diseases depends on the circadian time of inoculation. The concepts of chronobiology and chrono-therapeutics can be used to generate disease prevention strategies based on these circadian-rhythm dependencies. Just imagine how the public could also be better protected not only against environmental threats, water contamination, food borne diseases through the use of remote sensing data and a worldwide food enterprise architecture, but through alerts that could flow into a person through Wearable Computing, Augmented Reality and the Veillances. Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom could flow into an individual alerting him/her that they need to immediately visit their doctor, or stop consuming certain products. Some examples of our current problem environment could change outcomes by using these tools: 1. Getting the right information at the right time ---the steroid injection that they got for pain from laboratory x (in Massachusetts) is contaminated ( Just in the USA, between September 2012 and March 2013 at least 44 people have died and over 700 are contaminated from fungal meningitis according to the CDC) and their life may be at risk; 2. Preventing potential water and or food poisoning --- on February 4(th,), 2013, a report regarding the drinking water in many places within the State of California containing large amounts of Arsenic. Since we eat year round vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, etc. from that State, it may require the public to be cautious. As discovery from new research expands our knowledge about our body, its genome, and the cause-effect of new drugs, it also provides an opportunity to bring not only all these types of information to the forefront of the patient regardless where she /he may be at, but enable the transition from a system that has focused on disease to one that will focus on wellness through prevention and hopefully improve the quality of our lives."
w,"We present two experiments to assess the relative impact of different levels of body animation fidelity on plausibility illusion (Psi). The first experiment presents a virtual character that is not controlled by the user (n=13), while the second experiment presents a user-controlled virtual avatar (n=24, all male). Psi concerns how realistic and coherent the events in a virtual environment look and feel and is part of Slater's proposition of two orthogonal components of presence in virtual reality (VR). In the experiments, the face, hands, upper and lower bodies of the character or self-avatar were manipulated to present different degrees of animation fidelity, such as no animation, procedural animation, and motion captured animation. Participants started the experiment experiencing the best animation configuration. Then, animation features were reduced to limit the amount of captured information made available to the system. Participants had to move from this basic animation configuration towards a more complete one, and declare when the avatar animation realism felt equivalent to the initial and most complete configuration, which could happen before all animation features were maxed out. Participants in the self-avatar experiment were also asked to rate how each animation feature affected their sense of control of the virtual body. We found that a virtual body with upper and lower body animated using eight tracked rigid bodies and inverse kinematics (IK) was often perceived as equivalent to a professional capture pipeline relying on 53 markers. Compared to what standard VR kits in the market are offering, i.e., a tracked headset and two hand controllers, we found that foot tracking, followed by mouth animation and finger tracking, were the features that added the most to the sense of control of a self-representing avatar. In addition, these features were often among the first to be improved in both experiments."
w,"As society continues to progress, automobiles have become a common sight in households worldwide. However, the increase in the number of vehicles on the road has led to a series of traffic safety issues. As a result, automotive safety has become one of the most popular research topics worldwide. Among them, Head-Up Display (HUD)systems can be applied to cars, serving as an assistant to driving and improving driving safety. Through the use of a head-up display optical system, drivers can see virtual images that display important driving information and road conditions in the direction of their line of sight, eliminating the need to look down at instrument panel information and navigation information. This reduces driver distraction and improves driving safety. As HUD technology continues to advance and develop, it will gradually integrate with autonomous driving systems, becoming a standard feature in future high-tech vehicles. Nowadays, the technology of automotive HUD on the market is gradually maturing, mainly including Windshield HUD (W-HUD)and Augmented Reality HUD (AR-HUD). However, the current car-mounted HUD can only display virtual images on a single projection distance. When the driver changes the observation due to changes in vehicle speed, the visual focus distance needs to be adjusted to adapt to the HUD projection distance. Long-term and high-frequency adjustments can lead to eye fatigue for the driver. To address this issue, this paper proposes the design of a car-mounted binocular parallax optical system. Based on the current research status, a method of using a single DLP micro-projection machine to separate two images and generate two Projection Generating Units (PGUs) to display binocular virtual images for AR-HUD is proposed. According to the initial architecture of the HUD optical system, which is a coaxial reflection optical system, an off-axis reflection vehicle-mounted parallax display optical system is constructed by using an off-axis rotating reflection mirror. Then, by changing the object distance of the PGUs to the primary reflection mirror, the two free-form reflection mirrors are combined to construct an off-axis reflection binocular parallax vehicle-mounted display optical system, thereby ensuring the projection of two virtual images at different distances. The optical system uses a 5.74 inch DLP micro projector with an eyebox size of 130 mmx50 mm, a far projection field of view of 10 degrees x3 degrees and a near projection field of view of 4 degrees x1 degrees, and a virtual image projection distance of 3.8 m and 7.5 m. Image quality evaluation is analyzed and explained from the aspects of the point cloud diagram, MTF curve diagram, grid distortion, illumination curve diagram, and image simulation. The key to the optical system is tolerance analysis, which helps to determine the allowable limits of different manufacturing and alignment errors. Manufacturing and calibration errors can be reduced to an appropriate level without degrading the image quality of the optical system. If the tolerance requirements are too strict, it may increase the difficulty in processing and arranging the optical components and may also lead to unstable imaging quality during actual use. By designing the tolerance range of the curvature radius of the lens and the windshield usage area, the distance between lenses and the windshield usage area, the X-axis offset lens and the windshield usage area, the Y-axis offset lens and the windshield usage area, the axial rotation of the lens and the windshield usage area, and the axial rotation of the lens and the windshield usage area, the statistical results of the optical transfer function of the system's virtual image plane were obtained using Monte Carlo method with 1 000 randomly selected samples. It can be seen that at a spatial cutoff frequency of 4.42 lp/mm, more than 90% of the MTF of the optical system is greater than 0.63, indicating that the tolerance distribution of the system is reasonable, the tolerance capability is strong, and the design results are ideal. The design result of the dual-path AR-HUD optical system in this paper shows that, through software control, the near projection virtual image plane and the far projection virtual image plane can be displayed simultaneously or in a time-sharing manner, which improves the driver's visual experience."
w,"Sign as the perception of the image and the horizon of its operation - spatiality with the way some of the elements. Proportionality portrayed and perceived as depicting the reality experienced. Sensation and reflection allow highlighted experience in the reflection. The elements of fragmentary lose vision for the vision of a horizontal reliefs. Intuition captures the essence of the veracity of the fact of presence. Each code contains meaningful signs. They can assess the examination, an external analysis for reducing meaningfulness. This phenomenon with images and displaying bear a double burden of code: granted logic and sensibility is not available. Therefore, search perception is achieved through specific patterns of things and circumstances of things. Lokalization and contemporary cultural globalization make space for thinking, perception. This tool is an example of intercultural communication phenomenon of international information space. The value system has become part of the information fields. This particular form of knowledge about the world updated categories of thinking of human consciousness. This contributes to the definition of individual identity, promising future. Market logic requires activity and appreciation, evaluation of screen product. In this case continued debate about the primary and secondary evaluation of some of the facts: art appreciation analysis yields economic expertise rating calculations. Social types of consumers are also heterogeneous: for example, housewives or amateur detective. Screen Art has the ability to perceive reality in terms of space time, date, prospects, etc. This point is the basis of certain knowledge, its real factuality. Screen culture parallel to the development of computer technology, it is synthesizing the core philosophical and psychological techniques in the process. Addiction to virtual means not only the ability to move, and its ability to define independence. This workspace will be located in the commemorative resources. Virtuality of aliveness of the screen production process raises the tone of our understanding of the product. Philosophical thought favors in this regard through expressive means. Challenges and prospects make screen art relevant, surrounded by inquiring turnover. This feeds the moment of screen reflections that offer opportunities for virtual communication and simulation. The value of the products associated with moments of actualization of the virtual. Objectivity of screen text simulated reflection of real life in it, so come up real directions in art. Activity screen product mediocrity characters and symbols is its virtual reality. Form-screen product actually affects the nature of signs and symbols that are involved in the creative process. Missing screen that does not light, is able to negate the image simultaneously losing field iconic forms. The advent of the television signal is technical symbolic united modern. New technologies, new film, new photography, and hence the new value. Information technology, putting people to a new level with no spatial boundaries, is integrating national information space in a single stream. These realities have taught viewers to modell images by electronic means. Simulacrum is a copy of reality that never existed (according to J. Bordiyyarom). Simulacrum does not simulate postmodern trends in culture, the lack of reality precludes comparable acts. Item of televirtuality in the TV shows takes primary role as a substitute for the missing event-reality, that is a simulacrum. This raises the problem of identity. Screen Arts dictates life forms. Pictures with bright colors and mosaic of presentation sometimes become predominant convincing along with the realities of life. It shows televirtuality selfishness. Paul Vyrylo emphasized that the age threshold will be two realities: the actual and the virtual. Today, new technologies aimed at creating a more compelling than actual reality. Current state of the media is injected into a virtual person mode: impact on society has been restructuring methods and forms of influence on society. Create a character-forming simulacra models, which person and society would be filled with symbolic and symbolic reality. Living surrounded by symbols and signs creates a virtual essentially human."
w,"The purpose of the paper is to summarise and present the scientific-methodological and conceptual aspects of business management and organizational development of tourist enterprises of Poltava region in the context of sustainable growth. Methodology. The methodological basis of the research is general scientific research methods: methods of scientific analysis and synthesis, in particular, system-logical analysis of the influence of modern information and innovative technologies on the organizational development of tourism enterprises that allows creating the prerequisites for sustainable development. The rationale for the introduction of a virtual cluster based on the process and system approaches, where the main source of information is the scientific works of foreign and domestic scientists and practitioners. Results. The structural-logical scheme of organizational and economic support of the virtual association of tourist enterprises of the Poltava region is formed. The main participants of the virtual association of tourist enterprises of the Poltava region are singled out. Scientific novelty. The expediency of creating a virtual association of tourist enterprises of the Poltava region as an instrument of organizational development in the context of modern, global trends in the development of the tourist sphere is substantiated. Participants of the virtual association, goals and objectives, principles are singled out. It is determined, which priority tasks of the Poltava region will the virtual association able to solve. Practical implications. It is determined by the possibility of using these research results in the development of regional tourism development programs in the Poltava region and the establishment of projects for the development of tourism enterprises. Conclusions. The choice of such a form as a voluntary tourist virtual association is due to the fact that, as world practice shows, it will help to reduce information gaps between the market of tourist services and modern realities. Virtual association of tourism enterprises should function on the principle of self-financing. The selection of the proposed association as the main link of the information and logistics link of the Poltava region will allow diversifying sources of financing (public organizations, tourism enterprises, regional budget funds). The purpose of the virtual association will be: to increase the level and the capacity of participants of the association by facilitating the exchange of information, experience; accumulation of data on goods and services of tourism enterprises, which are a composite tourist product of the Poltava region as a tourist destination; ensuring the interrelation between the participants of the association at the local, regional, and national levels for the promotion of tourism services, defining the range of activities where the interrelations between the participants of the association are necessary (transportation, organization of excursions, leisure, provision of medical and recreational services, advertising like that). Thus, the introduction of the proposed virtual association of tourist enterprises will ensure the joint coordinated activities of all participants in the tourism services market, other institutions and organizations and public authorities on the basis of the integration approach. At the level of a tourist enterprise, the functioning of the proposed association will solve problems of information and marketing support, which will help to improve the effectiveness of their management. A promising direction of the study is the development of the organizational and economic mechanism of a virtual association of tourist enterprises in the Poltava region."
w,"The core aim of motion-recognition technology is to detect moving targets and extract the target's movement characteristics, classifying these so as to judge the corresponding action category. Moving target detection and tracking form the core of computer vision research topics in military visual guidance, robot visual navigation, industrial product detection, medical diagnosis, traffic monitoring, and virtual reality, and is also very important in terms of practical value and the broad prospects for development in other fields. However, in human behavior recognition algorithms, the background, light, environment, and other factors make identification accuracy difficult to obtain and unstable, with limited application scenarios. Because traditional target detection and tracking is based on monocular vision algorithm robustness, which is poor, this makes it difficult to detect and track moving targets in complex environments. In recent years, with the maturity of target detection and visual range-finding technology, pure static target visual barium distance or the depth of target detection cannot meet the demand of the market. Therefore, we need the efficient collection of deep information in moving target detection systems. Binocular stereo vision technology, as a hot research field in computer vision, can be widely used in the field of sports to achieve target detection and ranging functions. In view of this, this paper adopted a stereoscopic vision for use in target detection and tracking methods. This paper proposes a stereo-matching method based on hierarchical network minimum segmentation, where the method uses three-dimensional images from two layers of the pyramid decomposition by splitting the global optimal search strategy into a minimum at the top of the image to match with the initial parallax at the bottom of the image through regional gray correlation matching. Both reduce the search space of the stereo matching and improve matching accuracy. At the same time, this paper uses the motion of a football shot to prospect this recognition method, which can identify the target area. The Snake contour model method was also utilized to extract the target contour. This method has the following three characteristics: when ambient light changes slowly and suddenly, it can correctly detect moving targets; when the object is lit with cast shadows, the moving target can be detected correctly and is not affected by the shadows. When rigid target motion and deformation occur, it can correctly extract the target contour."
w,"The relevance of the chosen topic is due to the fast-moving process of digitalization of the life activities of society in general, and education in particular. Traditional education is losing its relevance and competitiveness in the modern labor market, which causes the tendency to transform the educational process towards digitalization. The use of information technologies in the educational process (both traditional and modern) makes it possible to provide all participants of the educational process with continuous education in the period of the distance format. Purpose of the article was to analyze the role of information technologies in the preparation of modern graduates of higher education institutions, taking into account the martial law. To achieve the purpose of the article, the following general scientific methods of learning social phenomena and processes are used: logical-historical, structural-functional and comparative; analysis and synthesis; classifications; structural and functional analysis; generalization. The term information technologies was analyzed and it was highlighted that they contribute to the provision of a new level of education (the ability to study from any corner of the world, build an individual student trajectory, facilitate communication between a student and a teacher, etc.). Varieties of information technologies in the educational process and its digitalization as a whole are studied: automated educational systems, intelligent educational systems, interactive programs, multimedia technologies, virtual reality, the Internet. The place of innovation in the educational process and its difference from novelty are highlighted. It is emphasized that the strategic task of the state today is the modernization of higher education of Ukraine at the level of international standards, and the fulfillment of this task becomes possible under the condition of improving pedagogical skills and introducing the latest information technologies into the educational process. Taking into account the close connection between a person's level of education and his professional development, the introduction of information technologies into the educational process is gaining increasingly more relevance. And solving this problem requires, first of all, joint efforts and mobility around the reconstruction of the system of higher education during the period of martial law, and, accordingly, its complete transition to a digital format."
w,"Under modern conditions, characterized by the development of information technologies, the approach to trade activity has been changing fundamentally as its movement to the virtual reality brings changes in the sphere of management and determines the organization of accounting. The current pace of development of computer systems and technologies has led to the development of e-commerce, the possibility of function of which is provided by the information systems. Methodology of research, analysis of last researches and publications. Rapid growth of e-commerce market and the existence of practical issues concerning the organization and the peculiarities of functioning of the appropriate entities have been formed a scientific interest in the task solving. The need for accounting approach to e-commerce activity subjects has been identified the relevance of research. The purpose of research is to generalize the researches regarding the e-commerce and its components, formation of a common understanding of organization and the features of e-commerce business entities with the definition of the accounting aspects in order to ensure efficiency. Subject of research. In the article the essence of e-commerce and peculiarities of its implementation in connection with the development of e-commerce in Ukraine and in the world has been considered. The activity of Internet-shops as one of the most popular e-commerce systems has been researched. Advantages, disadvantages and feasibility of functioning of Internet-shops compared to other systems have been identified. The place and role of accounting as well as the features of its organization in creating of Internet-shop have been determined. The features of accounting according to the different ways of payment have been considered. Results of research. The development of e-commerce in Ukraine and in the world contributed to the development of the activities of Internet-shops as one of the most common of its systems. The ability to save money and time when buying goods contributed to factors of this kind of e-commerce system in Ukraine. However, during the organization of this type of trade it is important to take into account the negative impacts, one of them - the need to develop electronic payment systems. Organization of operation of Internet-shops has a number of features and in the first place it is provided by the Internet-site that initially requires an investment, but in the future development minimizes costs and is more efficient and less expensive way of doing business in the modern world. In the research the different aspects of Internet-shops, taking into account the methods and organization of accounting, have been considered, the possible expenses at the beginning of activity and in the further development of this type of trade have been identified, the various ways of purchase by customers, that determine in complex the characteristics of functioning of the Internet-shop, have been considered. Thus, accounting in modern conditions being still a source of high-quality (accurate, timely) information for management system has been developing and transforming in parallel with changes in the types of business, appearance of new objects and requests for information by appropriate users. In the article the peculiarities of the activities of the online shops in modern conditions have been considered, in further research the other types of such business models should be more studied. In addition, as e-trade is actively growing, the analysis of problematic issues becomes the main tasks: pricing, product range, delivery and payment."
w,"This article presents a comprehensive literature study showing that, starting from the emergence of the species of homo sapiens, the progress of human civilization is strongly dependent on the development of materials, and over time this is mainly development of engineering materials and the accompanying increase in productive forces. There is no close correlation between changes, and especially between the development of the brain and technologies sequentially controlled by humans. The materials science appeared as an independent branch of knowledge only in the late 1950s. Technical aspects of the product launch on the market relate to several technical aspects; engineering design is a significant conceptual phase of this activity, and within it, the material design. The expected functional properties of the product will be assured only if the right expected material is used and is produced in a suitably selected expected technological process that will provide both the expected shape and other geometric features of the product, including assembly and the expected structure of the material, ensuring the expected mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the material, the use of which ensures the expected application of the product. The given rule defines the paradigm of contemporary materials science and engineering. Without the use of engineering materials and without the development of manufacturing processes, it is impossible to manufacture any product and make it available to consumers. The material design process in history has gone through a long period of changes. Initially, for millions of years and almost a century ago, materials were selected based on the trial and error method, which is stage Materials 1.0. Currently, about 80 % of work in the field of engineering materials development and material design is carried out in accordance with the Materials 2.0 protocol. The Materials 2.0 protocol includes more systematic material research, ranging from conceptualization, systematic laboratory experiments to verify the idea, prototyping in the laboratory and real conditions, and testing and validating prototypes and life cycle assessment to use the results of research in product production. Materials 3.0 use computational materials science materials, and materials are computationally designed with a target functionality. Only the idea of Materials 4.0 overcomes human limitations in applying existing knowledge about the theory of materials, processing, and properties through the use of cyber-physical space. In manufacturing processes generally after the era of water and steam and mass production based on the division of labor with the use of electricity, and then the use of electronics and information technology for the automation of production processes, there is a dynamic use of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of objects, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, currently guaranteeing the production progress at the stage of the Industry 4.0 industrial revolution. So far, nine technologies have been designated as determining the change in industrial production at the Industry 4.0 stage. According to the authors of this article, it is necessary to augment this list by manufacturing processes and engineering materials as well as living and bioengineering machines; therefore, in total, there will be 12 technologies determining the changes in production in the Industry 4.0 stage. Omitting these issues would make it impossible to manufacture any products available on the market, and the idea of Industry 4.0 presented would be incomplete. The importance of carbon-based materials is also presented, and several results of our own research on various materials are presented, with an indication of application possibilities."
