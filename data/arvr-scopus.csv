Among, several social networks which are specialized in the field of tourism, TripAdvisor is defined as the biggest online journey - community in the world, which has been able to change the way of how people show their interested in a touristic product or service, on how to plan the trip or how to get information about the touristic experience of other people. TripAdvisor, displays millions of travelers' opinions in 47 countries around the world, as well as, a wide variety of options on how to plan a trip. This social network, also has more than 290 million opinions and comments over 5.3 million accommodations, restaurants and touristic destinations. Ecuador is in the ranking of countries that are part of this virtual community, considered as one of the places with the most recent touristic potential, due to, among other reasons, its environment, cuisine, cultural and social wealth, which makes it an emerging worldwide touristic destination Based on what was mentioned above, it was decided to focus this communication in the Andean country and within it, in the restaurants located in the most representative cities of Ecuador, such as, the Coast Region, Highlands, Amazon Region and Galapagos Islands, with the main purpose of knowing the traveleŕs profile, who makes comments of the Ecuadorian Restaurants on TripAdvisor.com, as well as the rating achieved by establishment.

However, few studies have discussed the benefit, which brands could attain by operating on Facebook Pages. This study took place in Taiwan where Facebook has been very popular and aims to understand the motivation and results regarding brand experience of consumers when using social networks and the reasons affecting consumers' willingness to use companies' Facebook Pages. In doing so, we propose a model to discuss the influence from intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: brand experience and E-Word of Mouth (E-WOM). Our results show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively influence brand experience; brand love and customer effort both directly influence brand experience. Yet, brand experience influences E-WOM directly and through Facebook pages such as loyalty.

However, it often fails to establish a substantial level of partnership—customer-designer collaboration. There is a need for design methodologies that tailor products around customers' specific needs and preferences while keeping the customer's voice and input in the loop throughout the preliminary design phase. This approach is vital for designing medical and healthcare products since customers' physiological and cognitive needs demand high levels of product individualization. This chapter introduces the Digital Co-Creation framework as an alternative method to alleviate challenges associated with mass customization. The framework is demonstrated via a lower-limb prosthetic casing design case study, which presents how customer-designer collaboration allows the individualization of a lower-limb prosthetic casing for two hypothetical customers with contrasting needs and preferences. The overall strategy calls for collaborative design with digital technologies and tools such as digital human modeling, enabling products tailored to customer needs and preferences, aligning with the goals and objectives discussed within the Digital Patient concept. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effectiveness of this unique advertising strategy has not been investigated in the IS research literature. This study sheds light on the effectiveness of advergames by introducing three design elements of an advergame: interactivity (the extent to which a player has control over the choice of viewing the advertising message), relevancy (the extent to which the game context identifies with the advertising information), and expectancy (the extent to which the advergame form is within the expectation of the player). Two dependent variables, attitude toward advergame and attitude toward brand, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the advergame. Based on the transportation theory, we hypothesized two-way interaction effects between each pair of the three independent variables on the attitude toward the advergame, and also main effects of the dependent variables on the attitude toward a brand. A 2*2*2 factorial design experiment in a virtual world environment was used to test our hypotheses. The results indicate that in the condition of high relevancy, a more favorable attitude toward advergame was found for both high interactivity and low expectancy. Contrary to our hypothesis, in the low interactivity condition, high expectancy generates a more positive attitude toward advergame. Interestingly, interactivity was the only independent variable found to have a significant effect on the attitude toward brand.",Advergame; Attitude toward advergame; Attitude toward brand; Expectancy; Interactivity; Relevancy; Transportation theory,Information systems; Virtual reality; Advergame; Attitude toward advergame; Attitude toward brand; Expectancy; Interactivity; Relevancy; Marketing,

The simulation by itself does not replace reality but substantially improves quality. Company information systems often abound in data and information overloading. Sometimes nobody uses them and the information system does not work as a whole. For better understanding and company integration we look for more powerful tools for decision making in real time. Business flight simulators can provide company information strategy with suitable tools for decision making. Business flight simulators are able to create different ""whatif"" scenarios and analysis. Results from company information systems, data warehouses and other unstructured sources (texts, spreadsheet programs, market behavior, economic index of other companies, etc.) could be used as data. All summary indexes, on the basis of the data history, are able to create predictions and help future progress. The level of strategic planning and production control is very closely linked with other strategic areas such as marketing, trade or economy. The access to real data is one of the advantages which can be supported by simulators and can help managers make a decision and see the future impact these decisions may have. The simulator can not be isolated but it has to be integrated into the company's information system.

In addition to identifying the factors influencing store selection, the paper investigates how these differ between shoppers and non-shoppers, and identifies the factors that affect the amount of money spent in virtual world shopping environments. The findings suggest that ""Core Store Features"" and ""Security and Privacy"" constitute the most important store selection factors in virtual environments and that sales in VWs are predicted by the frequency of visiting and the time spent within VWs' stores.

First, it discusses the conceptual architecture and operation mechanisms of SCM, then formalizes the meta-model of cooperative processes deployed on SCM. By introducing a model transformation function into the formalization, a static process model can be extended to a dynamic one. In virtue of the reflection capability, structural reconstruction and behavioral adaptation of the dynamic processes can be achieved in SCM by introspection and effectuation. In terms of the conceptual model of SCM, a process virtual machine (PVM) is designed as a running container for cooperative processes. Borrowed from the power of MDA mechanism, the model of a business process can be transformed successively from design to run time. The business processes established on SCM can be more flexibly and extensively applied to various open environments, and leverage modern enterprise computing.",Dynamic process; Process virtual machine; Reflection; Service cooperation; Variable structure,Calculations; Computer software; Computer supported cooperative work; Management information systems; Mathematical models; Middleware; Process control; Virtual reality; World Wide Web; Business process management; Dynamic processes; Enterprise computing; Process virtual machines; Reflection capability; Service cooperation; Variable structure; Web services; Marketing,

In this paper we investigate the effects of different 3D online store layouts on user perceptions in the e-retailing context. We build on recent research on store atmosphere that classifies store layouts in 3D environments as “avant-garde”, “warehouse”, “pragmatic”, “boutique” and “department”. Reflecting the dual identity of individuals as both consumers visiting virtual stores and users interacting with graphical user interfaces, we employ key constructs from both the marketing and the information systems literature to build our research model. The study measures how Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Merchandise Quality Perception and Store Perception vary across the distinct store layouts. We employ a laboratory experiment in the apparel industry to test our model. Our results show that the layouts lead to different perceptions, although the consumers’ Shopping Motivation does not moderate this effect. Building on the differences found on store layout effects on user/consumer behavior in the 3D online context, the paper discusses relevant research and practical implications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",3D online store design; Electronic retailing; Experimental design; Store perception,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH

However, rigorous assessment on usability of such tools is needed to ascertain the likely effect on the profession. A previous study consulted with a small group of urban professionals, who concluded in a satisfaction usability test that online VR had potential value as a usable 3D communication and remote marketing tool but acknowledged that visual quality and geographic accuracy were obstacles to overcome. This research takes the investigation a significant step further to also examine the usability aspects of efficiency (how quickly tasks are completed) and effectiveness (how successfully tasks are completed), relating to OpenSimulator in an urban planning situation. The comparative study pits a three-dimensional VR model (with increased graphic fidelity and geographic content to address the feedback of the previous study) of a subdivision design (in a Dunedin suburb) against 3D models built with GIS (ArcGIS) and CAD (BricsCAD) tools, two types of software environment well established in urban professional practice. Urban professionals participated in the study by attempting to perform timed tasks correctly in each of the environments before being asked questions about the technologies involved and their perceived importance to their professional work. The results reinforce the positive feedback for VR of the previous study, with the graphical and geographic data issues being somewhat addressed (though participants stressed theneed for accurate and precise object and terrain modification capabilities in VR). Ease-of-use and associated fastest task completion speed were significant positive outcomes to emerge from the comparison with GIS and CAD, pointing to a strong future for VR in an urban planning context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",3D Virtual environments; CAD; Effectiveness; Efficiency; GIS; Satisfaction; Urban design,Computer aided design; Efficiency; Geographic information systems; Usability engineering; Virtual reality; Urban planning; 3-D virtual environment; Comparative studies; Effectiveness; Planning and design; Professional practices; Satisfaction; Software environments; Urban design; Design tasks; Geographics; Opensimulator; Planning tasks; Virtual reality technology; Urban planning; Efficiency,Kluwer Academic Publishers

Innovative technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) and virtual reality (VR) are applied to test human status. The DSS combines four sets of indicators in a multi-attribute decision analysis and identifies the areas with the largest stress-recovery potential. Two multi-attribute model—one in summer and one in winter—are elaborated to obtain a dynamic evaluation of suitability. Results show significant differences among forest type, forest management, altitude range, and season in terms of stand suitability. EEG and VR seem to be promising technologies in this research area. Strengths and weaknesses of the approach, as well as potential future improvement and implications for territorial marketing, are suggested. © 2021, The Author(s).",Ecosystem services; Regional planning; Smart living; Socio-ecological dynamics; Territorial marketing,Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Marketing; Recovery; Sustainable development; Decision support system (dss); Dynamic evaluation; Future improvements; Innovative technology; Multi-attribute decision analysis; Multi-attribute models; Multi-criteria decision support systems; Psycho-physiological; Forestry,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH

Thus, a direct link between exchange and retail investors does not exist. However, financial exchanges offer services to retail investors. Thus, from a marketing perspective, retail investors are their direct customers. Caused by the bank-intermediated transaction chain on financial retail exchanges a direct customer relationship management (CRM) among exchanges and their customers is hardly possible. This circumvents a customer oriented product and pricing policy. Thus banks, as they are nowadays the direct link between exchanges and retail investors, define the market micro structures of the financial exchanges to a large extend. This is true not only for the bank driven whole sale trading but as well for the retail trading. Ongoing developments of new exchange facilities for the retail trading, such as best execution functionalities, downsizing of the odd lots, adoption of trading hours, the emergence of electronic off exchange trading systems etc. show, that there is a need for improved retail trading platforms. To overcome these CRM related problems in the financial exchange industry a joined project between the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Potsdam University was set up to implement a platform for a direct CRM among retail investors and financial exchanges. This project relies on web 2.0 technologies to build up a virtual community where the exchange and retail investors can share information about needs, requirements, and ideas about the market model for a retail trading platform and other relevant trading and settlement facilities. The aim of this contribution is to describe this platform and their advantages for retail investors and for stock exchanges and to provide an outlook of the applicability of web 2.0 technologies in the financial exchange industry.

Based on existing studies that primarily address two-dimensional (2D) urban structure, this paper focuses on the threedimensional (3D) structure relating to the 3D urban form. Given their greater clarity and possibilities for quantitative analysis, both 3D digital urban models and GIS spatial overlay analysis methods hold tremendous potential for analysing and predicting future urban form. In this project, the Xidan Business District in Beijing's Inner City was the area selected to implement the digital-city application. Under the hypothesis that the existing urban spatial structure is determined by the city's urban planning scheme and current urban marketing forces, it is found that actual urban development does not follow the planning restrictions on zoning and building height regulations. Some contradictions and conflicts, such as building location and height, appeared in the studied district. The specific reasons for the discrepancies need to be further studied. © 2005 Springer.",3D city modeling; GIS; Remote sensing; Virtual environments,Architectural design; Geographic information systems; Project management; Remote sensing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Urban growth; Virtual reality; Zoning; 3D models; Building height; Business district; City modeling; Digital cities; Interrogation techniques; Overlay analysis; Planning scheme; Three dimensional (3D) structures; Urban development; Urban form; Urban model; Urban planners; Urban spatial structures; Urban structure; Three dimensional,

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative-based approach was followed by a questionnaire survey, which was completed by 230 respondents comprising graduate and postgraduate students, using structural equation modelling. Findings: While the trait of openness was positively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms, the trait of neuroticism was negatively associated with the perceived ease of use of AR. Extraversion was positively associated with subjective norms. Perceived ease of use of AR, the usefulness of AR and subjective norms were positively associated with attitudes toward AR. Practical implications: The data gathered will add a valuable contribution to the currently limited data available on empirical consumer behaviour research, particularly in relation to the adoption of AR for interactive marketing.

However, there is no coherent understanding of the state-of-the-art of the literature on VR shopping, how VR shopping has been investigated and what empirically indicated benefits VR has for a variety of marketing outcomes. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically review the published body of literature on VR shopping (N = 40). The current study contributes to the VR shopping and marketing literature by mapping the VR technologies, product types, consumer experiences and research methods in the extant literature. The review shows that the literature on VR shopping is still in its infancy and there remains ample room for progression both in breadth and depth in the literature on VR shopping in terms of methodological rigor and theoretical prowess. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

Building upon the marketing, social psychology, and information system literature, this study empirically examines a set of functional determinants derived from the technology acceptance model and socio-psychological determinants drawn from the theory of reasoned action and social cognitive theory that may be responsible for the motivations of participants in online social networks. We propose a model by integrating functional, social, and psychological factors in predicting attitude and online social network usage. The survey outcomes from a cross-sectional study among 387 Facebook users in Malaysia support the hypothesised model. This study contributes by extending the cognitive learning theories in predicting online social networking usage. Particularly, this research presents a different perspective on online social networking by exploring the mediating effect of attitude and the moderating role of individual characteristics. This study demonstrates that desirable changes in the perception of functional benefits, self-efficacy, and need for cognition as well as perceptions of social pressure from significant others might lead to corresponding changes in attitude towards online social networking. Results of the study support the model efficacy and predictive ability of the proposed integrative model which may serve as a theoretical foundation for future researchers interested in examining other virtual community engagements such as blogging, online advertising, and online public relations activities. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",attitude; cognitive learning theories; need for cognition; online social network; self-efficacy; social influence; social networking behaviour,Commerce; Marketing; Online systems; Public relations; Social sciences computing; Virtual reality; Websites; attitude; Cognitive learning theories; Need for cognitions; On-line social networks; Self efficacy; Social influence; Social networking (online),Taylor and Francis Ltd.

We characterize the revenue mechanisms behind each model, by incorporating the concept of horizontal and vertical supply chain integration of digital media industry. We incorporate the core value of digital media development in the first model, which considers digital media as information goods. Pricing, quality differentiation, quantity discrimination, and content design combined determine the VW popularity and the financial performance. Based on the first model, the second model incorporates the advertising revenue. It becomes essential to optimize both information goods revenue and advertising revenue, while increasing one would decrease the other due to the traffic dynamics. Based on the first two models, the third model considers both vertical and horizontal supply chain integration in the digital media industry. In this model, we add one extra dimension of network externality that leads to better understanding of consumers, suppliers, and their mutual interest. Based on these three models, we suggest several strategic implications that facilitate operations, increase revenue, and enhance consumer experience, including strategic alliance, reduction of virtual-real world barriers, and tailored advertisement.",Information goods; Social media; Virtual media development; Virtual world,Digital storage; Information systems; Marketing; Supply chains; Virtual reality; Advertising revenues; Financial performance; Information goods; Quality differentiation; Social media; Supply-chain integration; Virtual media development; Virtual worlds; Economics,Association for Information Systems

For many consumers, the intangibility of information system-based processes generates beliefs that they are fake, non-genuine, artificial and therefore inherently risky to use. This perceived artificiality phenomenon was shown to increase risk concerns, which in-turn inhibited system adoption. Investigating reactions to an e-service replacement of a paper process enabled testing of this proposed conceptual causal chain. Results suggest that the inherent intangibility of e-services creates concerns measured in raised perceived artificiality and perceived risk. Interestingly, mental rather than physical intangibility increased artificiality concerns. Perceived artificiality directly increased risk concerns and indirectly affected system evaluation and adoption, which were primarily affected by system perceived risk. This exploratory research suggests a research model that provides a first step towards understanding the effect of information systems' inherent intangibility on system evaluation and adoption, and may be utilized when testing risk-reducing system enhancements.",,Cryptography; Evaluation; Human computer interaction; Information retrieval systems; Marketing; Risk assessment; Security systems; Software engineering; Virtual reality; E-services; Information systems (IS); Perceived risks (PR); System evaluation; Electronic commerce,

The method of transmission and communication changes concerning the environment and the needs of man. Therefore, marketing has become one of the main representatives and tools of communication in advertising. The development of technology is moving forward in various areas, so marketing communication is not lagging. Day by day, it increases the interconnection between people, companies and institutions through modern information tools. The time when marketing focused primarily on the sale of products and services has to some extent disappeared. The old way of promoting goods has become unattractive to society. Today, on the contrary, communication is advancing, the main interest of which is the feelings and emotions of consumers, and therefore it does not put profit first, but people's satisfaction. The presented article aims to increase the interest of the final consumer in the selected institution by applying a modern marketing strategy—event marketing. Within the application of event marketing, the tools Industry 4.0 were used, which use modern information systems to create a closer connection between the company and customers. For this particular application of Industry 4.0 tools and the implementation of event marketing, we chose a tour of the selected institution using a virtual tour, which should arouse customers' interest in a real visit to the institution and its services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Event marketing; Industry 4.0; Virtual reality; Virtual tour,Commerce; Industry 4.0; Information use; Virtual reality; Advertizing; Event marketing; Information tools; ITS Services; Marketing communications; Marketing strategy; Product and services; Sharing information; Virtual tour; Marketing,Springer

The aim of the study was to analyze how is the presence of different brands in the game NBA2K18, along with its different formats. NBA2K18 is a series of basketball video games developed by Sega Dreamcast. This study is positioned in the interpretative paradigm with a qualitative methodology. For data collection, the technique used was the participatory observation. As a result, it was evidence that the different participating brands in NBA2K18 have mimicked with the game storytelling in the players' self-realization process. They have applied both dynamic and static in-game advertising formats throughout the game. Brands have managed to be part of the narrative; this result would have been completely different if they had created a game from scratch as proposed by the advergaming model. © 2021 AISTI.",advertising; in game advertising; videogames; virtual worlds,Human computer interaction; Information systems; Information use; Interactive computer graphics; Virtual reality; Advertizing; Data collection; In game advertizing; Participatory observations; Qualitative methodologies; Realization process; Video-games; Virtual worlds; Marketing,IEEE Computer Society

The emotion assessment process was based on dynamic fusion of biometric channels such as EEG, GSR, respiration rate and volume, skin temperature and heart rate on top of Russell's circumplex model of affect. BioStories' broad scope also allowed for some spin-off projects namely mouse control through EMG that resulted in a patented technology for alternative/inclusive interfaces.

The emotion assessment process was based on biometric channels dynamic fusion such as EEG, GSR, respiration rate and volume, skin temperature and heart rate on top of Russell's circumplex model of affect. BioStories' broad scope also allowed for some spin-off projects namely mouse control through EMG that resulted in a tested technology for alternative/inclusive interfaces.

Both companies have gained benefits in the forms of customer loyalty, increased customer satisfaction, and less support calls. Our research suggests that companies designate employees to spend a few hours each week to monitor relevant virtual communities. This enables the company to develop an intimate yet informal relationship with customers. Lessons learned from this type of informal support are: the vendor employees need to clearly identify their positions, the support should be unofficial, and the community should not be used as another marketing channel.",Crm; Knowledge sharing; Online communities; Theory of weak ties; Vendor participation; Virtual communities,Customer satisfaction; Information systems; Online systems; Public relations; Software engineering; Virtual reality; Websites; Crm; Knowledge-sharing; Online communities; Vendor participation; Virtual community; Weak ties; Sales,

The study utilized a purposive sampling technique with a sample size of 225 and obtained responses through a structured questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to verify the proposed hypotheses. The findings demonstrated that the perceived quality of the system, the quality of the information, and the quality of the interaction positively influenced the perceived ease of use and usefulness of using car dashcams. Attitude and behavioral intention were affected by perceived ease of use and usefulness, while perceived usefulness had no influence on intention to use car dashcams. While hedonic motivation and price value impacted behavioral intention, social intention did not affect it. Attitude was found to fully mediate the path between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. The outcomes of the study incorporate a considerable amount of knowledge into the adoption behavior of telematics literature by integrating prevalent technology adoption models into a unified model: The information system success model (ISS), technology acceptance model (TAM), and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2).

The latest generation of networks is essential for the development of digital ecosystems of smart cities. It has been assumed that the smart city and 5G networks form an emerging technological area. The goal of the work is to study the structure of the development and implementation of new technologies for the urban environment on the sample of 5G-based technologies. For the analysis of new technologies in the selected subject area, a study of patent landscapes and scientometric analysis of the topic field has been conducted. The object of the scientometric analysis is the study of citation patterns. The use of the patent landscape is based on the information systems and databases of patent information developed by patent offices and commercial companies and consists of visualizing the logical connections between various indicators of patent activity, on the one hand, and technological and market trends, on the other. Together, the scientometric and patent landscape show the most promising areas of technological research.

The results suggest that a 3D virtual world environment has both positive (indirect) and negative (direct) effects on brand equity. The positive, indirect effect of the 3D virtual world environment occurs through feelings of telepresence and enjoyment, both of which contribute positively to brand equity and, in turn, induces a higher behavioral intention. The negative, direct effect can be explained using distraction-conflict theory, where attentional conflict is faced by users of a highly interactive and rich medium.

The extraordinary achievement of communities demonstrated the enormous potentials of technologies in supporting communication and self-production of contents to create strong communities. The program proposes to apply technologies to support a marketplace and to build a community around the education of Italian design. Leveraging the development of ITC technologies, the program integrates innovative web technologies 2.0, in order to: 1) Create, applying the most advanced web technologies 2.0, an environment where all active users (designers, design students, etc..), vendors or buyers, can develop ideas, concepts, events, opinions, about Made in Italy Design, joining potentials of vendors, designers, students, amateurs and curious; 2) Explain Culture of Project, display products’ characteristics, allowing the user/buyer to interact to capture the extra value of the product; 3) Use buyer's auto profiling and geo localization data to increase the offer and create feed-back flows which could be translated into networking; 4) Create data exchange with the logistic platform to assure the quality of logistic performance expected from the market; 5) Enable the sale of Design objects between the Italian SMEs (small, medium enterprises) and the potential buyers around the world (the business will focus mainly on the following markets: Brazil, Russia, India, China, Canada, USA, Mexico, Japan, Arab Emirates) trying to support Design SMEs in: - Reach the “critical mass” needed to build a wide catalogue of “Made in Italy” Design learning corses - Have access to an alternative sales channel, since they cannot bear investments in IT by themselves - Take advantage of DesignBest international visibility to reach new markets - Have access to e-commerce in an easy way (without problems related information technology structure, order management, invoicing, payment and shipment, returns and complaints management) - Leverage some supporting services to international sales and marketing (information, advice, training, data bank, market analysis, etc) - Spread the Italian Design culture through a platform of e-learning addressed to foreign companies and universities. Critical success factors of the project are: - A wide adhesion of Italian design schools to the marketplace, where they can offer part of their own catalogue (also ad hoc courses) exploiting a new channel (e-commerce) and entering on new markets; - The ability to attract the Design community (lovers, designer, students). © 2018 MCCSIS 2018 - Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems; Proceedings of the International Conferences on e-Health 2018, ICT, Society, and Human Beings 2018 and Web Based Communities and Social Media 2018.

In this study, the sustainability of a virtual community for teachers and educators were investigated. The research model borrows the key concepts from the IS continuance model, social influence theory, the uses and gratifications paradigm, and relationship marketing to explain user intention to continue using a virtual community, as well as intention to recommend the community to others. Satisfaction, commitment, group norms are found to have significant impacts on intention to continue using and intention to recommend. Among the three factors, satisfaction has the highest impact on behavioral intentions. Individual-related factors (purposive value and self-discovery) are found to have significant impacts on user satisfaction, while social-related factors are more important in determining commitment and group norms. The results of this study provide important implications for both research and practice.",Commitment; Information systems continuance; Relationship marketing; Satisfaction; Social influence; Uses and gratifications; Virtual community,Information systems; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; Commitment; Information systems continuance; Relationship marketing; Satisfaction; Social influence; Uses and gratifications; Virtual community; Marketing,

The state of the art in vehicle simulation has reached a level where full vehicles are analyzed through simulation but major difficulties continue to be present in interfacing the vehicle model with accurate powertrain models and in developing adequate formulations for the contact between tire and terrain (specifically, scenarios such as tire sliding on ice and rolling on sand or other very deformable surfaces). The proposed work focuses on developing a ground vehicle simulation capability by combining several third party packages for vehicle simulation, tire simulation, and powertrain simulation. The long-term goal of this project is to promote the Digital Car idea through the development of a reliable and robust simulation capability that will enhance the understanding and control of off-road vehicle performance. To this end we concentrate our attention on two main aspects: (1) development of a family of tire and contact models suitable for simulations ranging from high accuracy to real time for on/off-road conditions and extreme environments, and (2) investigation of co-simulation techniques suitable from a numerical standpoint to support long simulations of heterogeneous models that contain vehicle, tire, terrain, powertrain, and controls subsystems.

For comprehensively understanding every participant's attitude toward information in virtual communities, we classified members based on their activities of posting, viewing and accepting information. According to the classification, we further explore comparative importance of antecedents regarding to members' intention to adopt information for purchasing decision-making in variant groups. Data was collected by questionnaires and actual number of posting behaviors. Results show that the importance of economic, relational and social factors varies from different groups. Information shoppers, who browse most information and rarely post messages, view relational and social factors as main contributors toward intention to adopting information as a decision aid. Advice seekers, who expect to get effective recommendations and rarely post messages, think relational factors is a major determinant.

Herding is common in situations where consumers infer product quality from other consumers' choices and incorporate that information into their own decision-making process. The Internet affects the herding phenomenon in two ways. On the one hand, it provides more information about other consumers' choices, therefore making herding more feasible. On the other hand, it provides more details about product quality, thus making herding less desirable. This paper empirically examines those two effects in the context of online software downloading. We find significant herd behavior in our analysis, and, surprisingly, the provision of professional product reviews or user reviews does not significantly influence the herding phenomenon.

However, from the service provider's point of view they pose special challenges. In particular, unless the provider itself engages in content or service provision, the service relies entirely on its members for provision of services. The members should thus be seen as resources for service provision. This type of networked service production system implies challenges in terms of service quality management and, subsequently, value creation for community members. This paper explores these issues by revisiting service marketing and service operations literature on service quality. Our analysis of the literature indicates that firms facilitating virtual communities need to ensure the quality of their service by not only ensuring technical quality but also by nurturing the social aspects of the community that have an impact on the willingness of community members to provide service to each other.",Peer-to-peer; Service production system; Service quality; Virtual community,Information systems; Production engineering; Social aspects; Virtual reality; Networked services; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer services; Production system; Service marketing; Service operations; Service provider; Service provisions; Service Quality; Service quality management; Technical quality; Value creation; Virtual community; Quality of service,

However, as the data grows older, new data has to be collected in order to keep applications up-to-date. Consequently, it is of great importance to know the impact that a different mobility sample may cause. This aspect of analysis has been largely neglected in mobility data mining research so far. In this paper we therefore analyze the robustness of performance measures with respect to a changed GPS sample in outdoor advertisement. The evaluation of outdoor advertising campaigns is a challenging application because it requires the evaluation of mobility data on a very fine spatial level. Thus, the application has a higher dependency on routes of individual test persons than classical mobility surveys. In our robustness analysis we apply bootstrapping and subsampling in order to measure the effect of a) a repeated mobility survey and b) a mobility survey of smaller size. We conduct our experiments on a real-world data set from Swiss outdoor advertising. Our results show that the effect is comparably small for a typical campaign and may be mitigated further by increasing the campaign size. © 2011 IEEE.",bootstrap; GPS; mobility mining; outdoor advertising; robustness analysis; sampling; standard error,Data mining; Geographic information systems; Marketing; Virtual reality; Advertising campaign; bootstrap; Mobility surveys; outdoor advertising; Performance measure; Real world data; robustness analysis; Spatial levels; standard error; Surveys,

So, the objective of this research was to identify predictors of user benefits of ARRA in the retail food chain. By integrating the theory of information system success model, this study proposes a model to investigate the mediating effect of two values: (1) user satisfaction and (2) user continuance intention between quality perspective as explanatory variables (system, service, and information quality) and user benefits as the outcome variable. Both the mediating factors are found positively playing mediating roles among all proposed relationships.

This research investigates the profound impact of VR on museums, specifically focusing on its influence on visitor satisfaction, loyalty, and the democratization of cultural heritage. By combining the information systems (IS) success model, flow theory, and the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) model, this study offers a comprehensive framework to analyze the complex dynamics of VR integration within museums. The findings reveal that visitor satisfaction and loyalty are closely linked to the quality of information, system functionality, and aesthetic appeal in VR-enhanced museum spaces. Flow experience serves as a mediating factor, elucidating the psychological underpinnings of visitor engagement and the attainment of positive outcomes. By evaluating dimensions such as information quality (IQ), system quality (SQ), aesthetic quality (AQ), flow experience (FE), visitor satisfaction (VS), and visitor loyalty (VL), this research provides practical recommendations for museums seeking to thrive in the digital age. Also, the study explores the global accessibility facilitated by VR, making cultural collections accessible to diverse audiences and expanding the influence of museums worldwide. The research emphasizes the importance of information systems management and marketing strategies in maximizing the benefits of VR-enhanced museum experiences, ultimately leading to greater visitor satisfaction. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of VR’s impact on museums and calls for strategic interventions to ensure the continued relevance and growth of museums in the digital era. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cultural heritage; Immersive experience; Museums; Technology integration; Virtual reality; Visitor satisfaction,,Springer

Herding is common in such situations which require consumers to infer product quality from other consumers' choices and incorporate that information into their own decision-making process. The Internet affects the herding phenomenon in two ways. On the one hand, it provides more information about other consumers' choices, making herding more feasible. On the other hand, the Internet provides more details about product quality, thus making herding less desirable. In this paper, we empirically examine those two effects in the context of online software downloading. We collected data on daily software downloads and studied how the daily download market share is related to the cumulative number of downloads and to the professionals' and users' ratings. We find significant herd behavior in our analysis of customers' software choices. Surprisingly, the provision of professional product reviews or user reviews does not have a significant influence on the herding phenomenon. Our results suggest that consumers are in favor of information inferred from others' behavior, but choose to ignore other sources of information. Such results are consistent with the predictions of the informational cascades literature. Our results also indicate that the vast amount of information provided on the Internet may not have as great an impact on consumer decision-making as previously expected. This paper contributes to e-commerce and Internet marketing research by investigating and offering a more in-depth understanding of online consumer behavior.

A previous study consulted with a small group of urban professionals, who concluded in a satisfaction usability test that online VR had potential value as a usable 3D communication and remote marketing tool but acknowledged that visual quality and geographic accuracy were obstacles to overcome. This research takes the investigation a significant step further to also examine the usability aspects of efficiency (how quickly tasks are completed) and effectiveness (how successfully tasks are completed), relating to OpenSimulator in an urban planning situation. The comparative study pits a three-dimensional VR model (with increased graphic fidelity and geographic content to address the feedback of the previous study) of a subdivision design (in a Dunedin suburb) against 3D models built with GIS (ArcGIS) and CAD (BricsCAD) tools, two types of software environment well established in urban professional practice. Urban professionals participated in the study by attempting to perform timed tasks correctly in each of the environments before being asked questions about the technologies involved and their perceived importance to their professional work. The results reinforce the positive feedback for VR of the previous study, with the graphical and geographic data issues being somewhat addressed (though participants stressed the need for accurate and precise object and terrain modification capabilities in VR). Ease-ofuse and associated fastest task completion speed were significant positive outcomes to emerge from the comparison with GIS and CAD, pointing to a strong future for VR in an urban planning context.",3D virtual environments; CAD; Effectiveness; Efficiency; GIS; Satisfaction; Urban design,Computer aided design; Efficiency; Feedback; Geographic information systems; Virtual reality; Computer aided design; Efficiency; Feedback; Geographic information systems; Social networking (online); Virtual reality; 3-D virtual environment; Comparative studies; Effectiveness; Planning and design; Professional practices; Satisfaction; Software environments; Urban design; Urban planning; Urban planning,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing

Further, there have some efforts to extend such VR systems by adding product configuration, analysis, and manufacturing/production information services. The limitations of these previous efforts were that they used expensive and proprietary VR tools, and they did not address the issue of integrating distributed and heterogeneous data sources. This paper proposes an information system architecture to overcome these limitations. The architecture is composed of a product configuration module (PCM) based on Java and Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), and a product analysis module (PAM) based on Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). The PCM enables the users to virtually experience products from their own Web browsers on any computer platforms anywhere anytime. The PAM performs product analysis and provides decision-making information from distributed and heterogeneous data sources, for example, part information from vendors around the world. That is, the users can configure and virtually experience the products that they want to purchase on any client workstations such as PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix workstations. Further, they will be provided with the product analysis and manufacturing/production information from various data sources including relational databases such as Oracle, Sybase, etc. A prototype system has been implemented to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture.

A growing problem today for many companies is that of facing up to increasing global competition, increasing the importance of delivering the right product at the right time and at the least cost. To enable a company to provide competitive services, concurrent engineering methods are employed progressively more often. However, a truly effective concurrent engineering team requires specialists in a wide variety of occupations and skill bases. Effective communication and exchange of information between members usually require not only face-to-face meetings but also highly advanced tools. Various tools have been developed in the past with the premise of facilitating effective communication. However, these have realistically only covered a subsection of the total product development life-cycle. The work presented here displays an approach to the problem in terms of an Internet-based system, which provides a mechanism to allow integrated information sharing from the initial concepts through to the realization and the marketing of a product.

Knowledge must be shared across cultural and time-space boundaries to create strategic frontiers in global and virtual enterprises. However, we believe that organizations have barely scratched the surface of the ""knowledge sharing game"" played across virtual environments. In technology-based organizations, for example, technical knowledge must be meticulously captured and conveyed in a highly cognitive manner to have substantive benefits in raising the competence and productivity of globally-dispersed workers. In this light, we contend that richer forms of knowledge/media representations, such as virtual reality (VR) and 3D imagery, could be creatively utilized to enable improvements in knowledge management, especially within virtual workspace. We further argue that organizational learning evolves to a higher level only when knowledge management is radically improved and effectively exploits ""organizational memory"" with the aid of IT (Stein and Zwass 1995). This paper explores how a technology-based firm, APV Anhydro, has extracted technical knowledge from its experts and creatively presented such knowledge in rich media representations using VR/3D technologies. This enabled APV to share rich technical knowledge across its global marketing operations, and as a consequence, accelerated its organizational learning process.",,Information management; Information systems; Knowledge based systems; Societies and institutions; Virtual corporation; Virtual reality; Corporate knowledge; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational learning; Organizational memory; Technology-based firms; Virtual enterprise; Virtual organization; Virtual workspaces; Knowledge management,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc"
